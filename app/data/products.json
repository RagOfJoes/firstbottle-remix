    "description": "<p><em>“Best wine ever from here.”</em> - JS. <em>“There is an effortless grace to the 2016.”</em> - Vinous. <em>“...thrillingly textured, opulent and hedonistic…”</em> - JD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No small praise. Our price today will have you cheering, too! Huge scores, rockstar winemaker, world-class Napa Valley vintage, and for certain the finest yet from the legendary man himself! Vineyard sources, you ask? BECKSTOFFER TO KALON, BECKSTOFFER MISSOURI HOPPER, BECKSTOFFER DR. CRANE, AND STAGECOACH. Arguably the top vineyard sites in all of Napa make up this rockstar Napa Cab.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Made by the legendary Michel Rolland, the master winemaker, blender extraordinaire and enologist from Bordeaux. Michel, of course, is a \"super-consultant\" who has contributed to so many legendary wines -- Screaming Eagle, Harlan Estate, Sloan, Pavie, Smith Haut Lafitte, Ausone, Angelus, Pontet-Canet and dozens more major collectibles. Talk about pedigree!! Also worth mentioning, these wines are made at Alpha Omega and production is overseen by one of the most talented vintners we know, Jean Hoefliger, one of Michel's protégés. \r\n\r\n<p>A true blockbuster for the cellar and a terrific buy anyway you slice it. First come, first served!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: This is so lush and complex -- we’ll have to go with an old favorite from our local “snazzy” place, Press in St. Helena. They used to do (for $29) a “steakburger” – a large, rich hamburger smothered with mushrooms and onions in a wonderful light, but savory sauce. It’s fantastic. Here’s a <a href=\"https://cafedelites.com/salisbury-steak-with-mushroom-gravy/\">recipe</a>, as close as we could get to how they did it, but use fresh herbs and put some thyme in there. A little wine, too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: This puts us in the mood for some old school RUN DMC. <em>“It’s Tricky”</em>, <em>“King of Rock”</em>, go for it. Some LL Cool J might not hurt either!</p>",

    "description": "<p>We love, love, LOVE Manzone’s Barolos deeply. Five generations of winemakers have cultivated the same vineyards for over a century in the Monforte d’Alba. We’ve been huge fans and supporters for years, and even though their recent fame and notoriety means we get less wine than we’d like, we’re ecstatic to have this single vineyard Riserva available!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Coming from more than 50 year old vines on the steep slopes of the Gramolere vineyard, this wine stands across from the revered locale of Bussia, and maintains much the same soil composition: calcareous stones, sand, and fossils. The Riserva Gramolere is produced only in prestigious vintages – at a microscopic production of only a few thousand bottles. Plantings for this wine are from the top portion of Gramolere, known as Gramolere Soprana, where the extra exposure and long days add intensity and character to the grapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aromas here are primordial in nature – deep, dark and brooding notes of tobacco, rough leather, anise seed, and fresh turned earth. As the wine opens and evolves, taste and experience ripe black plums, black cherries, raw hazelnuts, and sweet, smoky oak. The finish is dry, long and salivating with myriad spice notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Fifth-generation vintner Mauro Manzone now runs the cellar, playing a chief role in taking the estate to ever greater heights. Principles of natural, non-invasive agriculture are followed in the vineyards, with no insecticides or fertilizers used…ever. The grapes undergo native yeast fermentation on the skins lasting 30-40 days with soft pumping over to guarantee a delicate polyphenolic extraction. Minimal amounts of SO2 are added and all the wines are unclarified and unfiltered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bad news: we don’t have much. Good news: what little we have, we’re sharing with you at 41% off retail AND a price drop on a purchase of 6 or more bottles! Don’t miss out on this rare and collectible beauty!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: This is a special wine, worthy of something equally special. <a href=\"https://www.insidetherustickitchen.com/ossobuco/\">Ossobuco Milanese</a> is just the celebratory meal to bring this all together!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: <em>“There are two kinds of spurs, my friend. Those that come in by the door; those that come in by the window.”</em> From the score for <em>\"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly\"</em> comes Enni Morricone’s masterful slow-build <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYI09PMNazw\">\"The Ecstasy of Gold”</a></em>.",

    "description": "Just 1,213 bottles were made of this magnificent, minerally, mouth-coaxing Ribera. $79.95 on 3 or more and free shipping on a serious up-and-comer! Super rare and on the forefront of the movement in Spain focusing on terroir-driven wines and not on over-extraction and judicious new-oak use. Don’t be fooled, this is not for the shy! This is all about pure black plum, blackberry syrup, mocha, and savory earth. It’s extremely elegant and packed with energy from its limestone soils which keeps it fresh and bright despite the ripe dark fruits. 95 points for Robert Parker's Wine Advocate and an incredible price considering how few bottles were filled for the world. While it lasts!",

    "description": "<p>If you know, you know! The Equipo Navazos sherries are true “insider” wines, so we are blown away to have a small parcel of the jaw-dropping Paolo Cortado that just landed. WOW! Built from Palomino Fino and touched with the perfect kiss of sweetness The GF stands for Gaspar Florido, a grower in Sanlucar where this cask was likely born from. Just 1,200 bottles of the magical elixir were filled from this single cask from a Solera between the age of 50 and 80 years old. An incredible and VERY RARE opportunity, to own and taste some bottled history. Chances like this do not come around often.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Eric Solomon: \"Gaspar Florido used to market two very old wines sourced from their soleras at their old cellaring facility at calle Rubiños, in the heart of the “Barrio” in Sanlúcar de Barrameda. When they decided to seize the real estate fever and sell their urban bodegas they had to move those butts to a shabby facility on the road from Sanlúcar to Trebujena. There is where I had the opportunity to sample them for the first time, on a visit with Álvaro Girón to an already old Gaspar in June 2006. We were very positively impressed by their quality and consistency, especially in contrast with the lack of distinction–to put it mildly–of the context there and then. There were quite a few butts of the outstanding GF-25 and only a few of GF-30, a very old and absolutely spectacular wine. It is precisely from the latter that this La Bota de Palo Cortado #51 Bota GF is sourced, a return to this source from our #41 Bota NO.\"</p>",

    "description": "<p>Neighbor to Petrus, Le Gay, and L'Eglise-Clinet with an additional plot next to Le Pin and Trotanoy. This is from hallowed dirt and priced at a level you just will not see again. Frankly, we still don't know how this deal happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The history of Chateau Rouget began several centuries ago. Already known at the end of the Roman Empire, the estate's terroirs were, at that time, merged with Saint-Emilion. It is also considered one of Pomerol's first official Crus. It has skyrocketed in quality since then and is still relatively under-the-radar (read: not $150+!!). </p> \r\n\r\n<p>The Labruyeres (of Domaine Jacques Prieur in Meursault, Labruyere in Moulin-a-Vent, and Champagne Labruyere, their newest project) hired top-gun consultant Michel Rolland to head the winemaking, and he adopted biodynamic and sustainable principles in the vineyard. It’s safe to say the Chateau has been absolutely crushing it the last several years. Enter the 2016 vintage, and all of the work and investment over the past two decades paid big dividends with near-perfect growing and harvest conditions. As James Suckling noted, <em>\"this could be the best wine ever from here.\"</em></p> \r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Rich, dark, opulent, hedonistic, and immensely satisfying! <em>\"The 2016 Rouget is a total turn on...undeniably delicious. I loved it.\"</em> - Antonio Galloni</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Please grab a few at our tremendous price...we will probably sell out!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Marinate a flank or skirt steak in 1/3 each of EVOO, soy sauce, and balsamic vinegar. Throw some rosemary or thyme leaves in, if you like. Paprika maybe. Black pepper. Let it hang out and throw it on a hot grill. Slice, eat with salad. Perfection!</p>\r\n\r\n<P>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Check out Cannonball Adderly, anything really, but <em>\"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy\"</em> is just killer with this Pomerol. Turn it up while you eat your flank steak and prepare for a wine/food/music epiphany.</p>",

This is a union of Burgundian royalty! With a stable foundation of 1er Crus from the southeast-facing hillside, the white wines speak to the very essence of Chassagne, with fragrant aromas, wonderful oak integration and powerful minerality. The rare reds from Chassagne are stunning with incredible purity and minerality that once made the Chassagne-Montrachet reds more widely planted than the whites! This brand new release from the exceptional '18 vintage is sensational!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It is hard to go wrong here. Almost irresistible now, this will age for a decade or more with ease.

Grab a few of these while we have them...just about 9 cases to sell and that’s it!</P>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>91-93 Jasper Morris, Biodynamically farmed, old-vines, approachable, rich, the excellent 2018 vintage!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Uttering the name \"Dominique Lafon\" in a room of wine geeks is enough for a loud room to fall into complete silence. Back in 2008, Dominique started his own label, apart from his day job making his family's wines at Domaine des Comtes. Lafon works with both owned and rented vineyards that are farmed and made by the Comtes Lafon team. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a serious pinot, a wine to cellar for a decade if you like: dark, potent and well-fruited, with solid structure, too. Crazy-attractive aromatics and a sense of energy. So good! You can read the info about the legendary Dominique Lafon on the details page, but suffice it to say the man is a force of nature, and his wines are HIGHLY desirable. Still can’t believe our price!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: If we were sitting at Ma Cuisine in downtown Beaune, we’d most definitely be ordering the roast chicken with vin jaune sauce and creamy mashed potato, AFTER the killer gougères and maybe a rabbit terrine...anyway, if you can just have a roast chicken, you’re good!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Just put on pretty much anything from Old Crow Medicine Show (except the live albums)!</p>",

Tasted back in January, this deep, polished red simply crushes the competition (to our palates) at ANYTHING in the $40 range, much less OUR price today. Buy as much as you can, you’ll wish you bought more!</P>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<P>Spice, elegance, silk, beautiful textures...it’s just a few of the words the critics heap on this lovely wine. We love it for its forward personaily and depth of flavor, something we rarely encounter at this price level, and we taste container loads of stuff like this every year! Leroy-Beauval is in the Entre-de-Mer region and dates back to 1780 (read the deets in our \"About\" section for more) but since roughly 2012 it has been on a huge qualitative roll and is one of those “savvy” buys for those who drink a lot of Bordeaux (like us!).</P>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<P>While this will definitely improve over the next decade, it's pretty irresistible now, for sure. So polished! Loads of black raspberry, dark plums, refined texture and toasty spices, with the “correct” Bordeaux notes of sweet tobacco and cigar box, and pencil shavings too. Damn delicious if we do say so ourselves. Wildly well-priced...time to stock up while we have it!</P>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<P>Side note: this is SUCH a great deal, don’t think you need to make something complicated. We drank this last night with a burger, and MAN, it was great. $24! Still can’t believe it!</P>\r\n\r\n<P>PAIRING IDEAS: Burger, of course! We also tried it with a Vietnamese beef salad, which rocked too. Hard to go wrong with just about anything!</P>\r\n\r\n<P>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Black Crowes. <EM>“Croweology”</EM> works great with this wine (and a burger!).</P>",

    "description": "<p>Cascina Adelaide is a relatively new Barolo producer to keep your eye on. Founded in 1999 as the culmination of a lifelong dream of founder Amabile Droco, this modern, gravity-fed winery sits just beneath the hilltop Castello di Barolo. We are one of the very few in the U.S. to have UNPRECEDENTED access to their top wines and we purchase every bottle they agree to sell us. This pricing is remarkable, the wine…even more so! 94 POINTS and decades of life ahead of it…just surreal.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The wine SINGS of nebbiolo...a perfect marriage of the classic crus that provide the fruit and a modern approach to the winemaking that takes advantage of the new, state-of-the-art facility. Cascina owns an enviable stable of top Barolo crus, like Preda, Bussia, Cannubi, and Fossati. These lots are blended together to make the 4 Vigne, separately from their single-cru bottlings. The nose pulses with Earl Grey tea, Indian spices, citrus oil, cherries and dried cranberry, balsam, and a long, spicy finish. This beauty is just starting to stretch its legs and has a veritable marathon ahead of it, but MAN, it is fun to just drink now after a really vigorous decant and dream of the future.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>All of Cascina Adelaide’s grapes are hand harvested and sorted before a 12-hour stay in the winery’s drying room to remove any residual moisture on the grapes. From there, the fruit is destemmed and lightly crushed in preparation for their roughly two-week fermentation and maceration in tank. Following primary, the wine is aged for 24 months in oak barrels, where secondary fermentation occurs. The wines are then bottled for months of further aging before release.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Read the press below...but...guys, this is a CRAZY good price. For an immortal vintage like 2016? Just JUMP all over this...go!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: A common dish for celebrations throughout Piedmont is Agnolotti del Plin, served in the reserved beef braising liquid from the filling will fill your belly and your soul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: On the topic of soul filling, Phillip Phillips' <em>“Home”</em> will get you into foot-a-stomping delirium sure to incite a bit of nostalgia.</p>",

But it’s most definitely for those who worship at the temple of Syrah in all of its purple glory. Just...wow! Read on for more, but do it QUICK -- not much to go around!! One for the ages!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The “Patou” is a single vineyard cru from a small, granite-laden “lieu-dit” with vines up to 80 years of age. It’s quite rare to see it here in the U.S. at all. Starting in 1983 to bottle their own wines, the Serrette family has been growing and selling grapes since 1915. They employ traditional methods like foot-treading and hand-harvesting. In short, it’s everything we look for and respect in wines of this caliber -- you MUST try a few at our VERY fine, direct-imported price!!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>As noted, EXTREMELY limited! First come, first served…!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: A must? Cheese. You MUST have some cheeses on hand for wine at this level of depth and concentration. Go with sheep's milk cheeses, if you can. The strength and robustness pair amazingly well. Beyond that, go BIG with lamb, venison steak, and the like. Rich sauces can hold up too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: <em>\"You Dropped a Bomb on Me”</em> by the Gap Band is ideal for this rollercoaster, inky beast!</p>",

That was all it took. The family started planting vines during their vacations there in 1997, then Pasquale enlisted the help of his brother, Gaetano, to run the cellar, and in 2002, the first release of their Brunello di Montalcino was produced! It has been a meteoric rise in the years since, and we are extremely proud to boast that we were one of the very first to bring these fantastic wines to the U.S. after meeting the family just seven years ago!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Rosso is the kind of thing we drink almost every night. 100% sangiovese and utterly happy-making, bright and fresh, percolating with red cherry, rose petals, red currants, mint, and licorice...and just about perfect with anything you eat. SUCH a deal at our price! Really...load up and drink this while your big gun Brunellos and Super Tuscans age.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The vines are 20 years plus, grown on rocky sandstone and silt at elevations of 200 meters and up. The hand-harvested fruit is fermented and macerated for a total of 30 days in stainless steel tanks before aging for 6 months in large Slovenian oak vats. Pop these wines with reckless abandon and be blown away by just how high up on the quality-for-value scale these beauties soar! For the monumentally amazing price of just $17.95, this might be one of the greatest deals in Tuscany, Italy, and the entire wine-loving world!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Weren’t you listening? So many things! Grab a copy of <em>\"Ottolenghi: The Cookbook\"</em> and just keep flipping pages until something catches your eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: If you would have told me that Eddie Vedder, solo, playing a ukulele on a movie soundtrack would become one of my favorite songs…well, I’m not quite sure what I would have said actually. But, here we are. Eddie hits all the right notes with <em>“Rise”</em>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>We’ve been incredibly fortunate to have met and started importing the rockstar-level La Fortuna wines for almost a decade now. They only get better and better, and with the late-release ‘16 Riservas coming out, it is time to get serious! This is a wine for the ages with a towering structure, salivating acids and glorious opulence, all while maintaining Fortuna's signature refinement. </p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Started in 1907, the entire estate is centered around their centuries old Tuscan farmhouse, where the family has lived for over a century. Around 20 acres of vines are planted between two vineyard sites: one near Fulginiae and the other in the south near Castelnuovo dell'Abate. The northern site is a bit cooler, while the southern vineyards are warmer and each year they blend fruit from both locations.\r\n\r\n.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>We don’t need to tell YOU about 2016. This has the power and finish and depth of the ‘15, but, as everyone will tell you, it has that extra level, that balance and age-worthiness and finesse that are NEXT LEVEL. Less than 2000 bottles made, less than 96 bottles were imported into the USA! Read the reviews below, but know that it is everything you know and love about the incredible La Fortuna wines in spades, and an extremely rare selection to boot. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: When it comes to Giobi, the man is a master of the Steak Fiorentino, so...gotta do that. Prime ribeye, of course, (tomahawk, anyone?) simply seared, slathered in the best oil you find. Do like Giobi does and throw a rib rack on there, too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Crank up some Ural Thomas and the Pain – the new single <em>“Gimme Some Ice Cream”</em> is great.</p>",

    "description": "<p>One of Tuscany’s finest producers doesn’t just do Sangiovese -- this rare bottling of Case Via is 100% organic Syrah that will BLOW you away!\r\n\r\n\r\nFontodi is already legendary for its “Flaccianello” and Chianti wines (some of the most coveted/collectible/high-scoring in all of Tuscany), but you might be surprised to know they make an absolutely stunning, unique, and wildly delicious Syrah. Rarely seen outside of Italy, this is a true gem. This is NOT for the shy, and while ultra-concentrated and plush, it has many layers of complexity and a silky texture, plus Fontodi's signature freshness that make for pretty thrilling drinking. Note that this wine has a 93.8 Cellartracker score -- that’s up there!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Since 1968, when the Manetti family acquired the property, which sits on a hill at the gates of Panzano, it has been completely renovated. The brothers, Giovanni and Marco Manetti, were still young when they started planting new vineyards in the Conca d’Oro, the beautiful vinous paradise that is Panzano in Chianti, one of the most coveted terroirs in all of Chianti and Italy for that matter. Fontodi is a certified organic estate, which since the beginning has not used herbicides or pesticides. The vineyard, which lies in the famous shell-shaped Conca d’Oro, opens up to the south like an oversized amphitheatre. The limestone marl soil is very rocky, shows slate parts and is ideally ventilated and drained. The Syrah grapes come from a south-facing location around Villa Pecile.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Epic, unique and rare to see for sale here...especially at our great price! ONLY 20 CASES!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: This wine really shines with cheese, so we’d go with a “white” pizza of some type, topped with any and all manner of mushrooms, arugula, grilled/fresh veggies (leeks, zucchini), truffles, fresh tomatoes, pancetta...mmm!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Can’t go wrong with some good ol’ Sublime <em>“What I Got”</em>. A quintessential song with a quintessential Italian wine!</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>\"Gorgeous\", \"all class\", \"seductive\", \"flamboyant”.</em>..all words from the pros, and we could not agree more. For us, this drinks like something twice the price -- closer to one of the Pavie wines, maybe. But this is $64.95! Wow! Load up!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Owned since 2020 by the owners of Chateau Calon-Segur in St. Estephe, and crafted by Technical Director Penelope Godefroy from the high-elevation vineyards (some of the highest in the appellation), this winery is on a wildly successful roll! Definitely underpriced. Have we said that? Beautifully made, with so much intensity and finesse, wrapping up all the concentrated blue fruits in a silky, terrifically harmonious mouthfeel and finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bravo, we say! Read the notes below, and make sure to get a few extra to put in the cellar. You’ll thank your future self!! While it lasts...!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Duck confit is the preferred meal with this wine, but if that’s not obtainable, you cannot go wrong with a simple roasted chicken. Throw in some cool mushrooms and carrots, a little red wine, and you’re off to the races.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: We're feeling some Fleetwood Mac with this wine! <em>\"The Chain\"</em> is our favorite of their songs. How about yours?</p>",

    "description": "<p>If you’re the person always looking for the “next thing” or just masterfully-made wine that is completely under-the-radar, you need to read this, and get some of the few cases we have!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where to start? First off, the wine really ROCKED us. That’s the most important thing. Honestly, this is one of the top discoveries we have made since we launched First Bottle, and we don’t say that lightly. A blockbuster blend of Graciano, Syrah, and Grenache, the latter of which was once thought to be Mourvedre when it was first widely planted in Paso, according to Brennan. This has an explosive nose of plum jam, fruit leather, blackberry, licorice, baking spices, and loamy earth. The palate is equally as powerful and super polished, delivering a Turley and Saxum-like experience that is layered and complex. Packed with plentiful blackberry goodness, black raspberry, and black cherry flavors that keep fresh and bright, despite the bold and ripe flavors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plenty to read in the “About” section, but to sum it up, Brennan Stover, in 2013, saw potential in a piece of battered land, adjacent to a quarry in the Adelaida District, with siliceous shale stone and Miocene marine sediments. He planted it at high density (2,000 vines/acre) and trained in the Échalas tradition found in the Cornas and Hermitage regions of the Northern Rhone in France. On 45+ degree slopes and with no irrigation, the vines represent extreme struggle and resiliency -- DRY-FARMED and ORGANIC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We only heard from a friend of a friend about this cool new project, and luckily made the connection. You’ve read our raves about it above, and with this fine pricing, we can’t say it enough! You need to try this!! It’s special stuff, and clearly a label that is going to be getting some serious attention VERY soon -- stoked to be ahead of the pack! Don’t miss!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: We went to a new spot in Calistoga last night called Picobar, and had the most delicious, simple, perfect duck mole tacos. THIS is what you want to eat with Quench + Temper! Dark spices in the mole play beautifully with the spicy Graciano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: We think this calls for some good old Peter Gabriel. <em>“Sledgehammer”</em> sets the mood, then move onto<em> “Steam”</em>, and roll into <em>“Solsbury Hill”</em> and <em>“In Your Eyes”</em>, among others. The man's a genius!</p>",

    "description": "<p>If you love the hedonistically rich, classically California styles of Turley, Saxum, or L'Aventure...you’re going to want some of this. Turley Cellars alum, Brennan Stover, used his years traveling up and down the wine regions of California to his advantage, finding an idyllic plot of land in the Adelaida District of Paso Robles. At an elevation of 1400’ in the foothills of the Santa Lucia Mountain Range, Brennan planted the BÃS vineyard in 2013. It was the peak of a five year drought... probably not the traditionally ideal time to plant an organic, dry-farmed vineyard on steep slopes of siliceous shale stone and Miocene marine sediments. And yet, out of that was born the name of “Quench + Temper”... a forging technique that strengthens steel through heating it to its very brink, then plunging it into liquid and back into fire again and again to increase the durability and resilience of the metal far beyond its natural capacity. Such was the philosophy of the vineyard planting – high density planty on meager soils, under intense conditions – ensuring that the surviving vines are hearty and durable, with low yields of intensely concentrated fruit. To add even more sadistic levels of stress to these poor vines, Brennan opted to train the plants in the Échalas tradition, named for the village in the Northern Rhone valley where this style was first used. Never submitted to the press, we heard from a friend of a friend, and luckily made the connection. With this stellar pricing, we can’t say it enough... You need to try this!!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The vineyard site is a south-east exposure within a stone’s throw of an industrial rock quarry – exposing a 500’ deep cut into the Mountain side (saves the need to dig your own soil pits throughout the vineyard!). At merely 20 miles from the Pacific Ocean, the climate experiences diurnal temperature shifts of 30 plus degrees for cool nights and warm days. All that and more is expressed in the luscious and delectable wine with killer aromas of black raspberries and blueberries and huckleberry reduction mingled with cigar box, plum jam, fruit leather, and licorice. The palate is equally powerful and superbly polished, delivering an experience that is layered and complex, with plentiful blackberry goodness, black raspberry, and black cherry flavors that somehow keeps things fresh and bright, despite the bold and ripe qualities of the fruit. One last time, this is one of the most exciting new projects we have come across in quite some time. Do yourself a favor and find a new favorite California red blend!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: This wine makes me want to go all nostalgic for my grandma’s Filipino Adobo. She’d haunt me for the rest of my life if I gave that recipe away, but luckily, this one here is pretty darn close. Brighten things up with a green mango salad (unripe mangoes, red peppers, carrot sticks, and cilantro tossed with s+p, lime juice and a dash each of sesame oil and fish sauce).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Elton John’s <em>“I’m Still Standing”</em> was the ultimate comeback song… a bold challenge to the artist’s critics, naysayers, and personal demons. Plus, it just rocks!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Brennan Stover, Turley Cellars viticulturist for decades, has made one of the most exciting wines we tasted in 2021, truly! If you’re the person always looking for the “next thing” or just masterfully-made wine that is completely under-the-radar, you need to read this, and get some of the few cases we have! Never submitted to the press, we only heard from a friend of a friend, and luckily made the connection. You can read our raves about it below, and with this fine pricing, we can’t say it enough! You need to try this!! It’s special stuff, and clearly a label that is going to be getting some serious attention VERY soon -- stoked to be ahead of the pack!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plenty to read in the “About” section, but to sum it up, Brennan Stover, in 2013, saw potential in a piece of battered land, adjacent to a quarry in the Adelaida District, with siliceous shale stone and Miocene marine sediments. He planted it at high density (2,000 vines/acre) and trained in the Échalas tradition found in the Cornas and Hermitage regions of the Northern Rhone valley in France. On +45 degree slopes and with no irrigation, the vines represent extreme struggle and resiliency -- DRY-FARMED and ORGANIC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graciano! It’s the powerful, complex black-skinned grape of northern Spain, often blended with Tempranillo and Grenache. You know a master viticulturist has a damn good reason to plant this where he did, and you only need to taste it to understand why. This is large-scaled, deeply colored and explosive on the nose, with sultry dark fruits, sweet currants, candied violets, balsamic reduction. It has a truly captivating mouthfeel - rich and opulent while keeping everything in fine, fine balance. A bit of a revelation honestly! It has the raw power of something you might taste from Ribera del Duero, without the rusticity... This is just California all the way, utterly delicious and simply incredible juice at our price today!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: So many ways to go here, but we’d pick a classic meaty paella. Bomba rice, tons of rich chicken stock infused with saffron, chicken thighs, spicy chorizo sausage, shrimp and tons of veggies, cooked to perfection with a crispy rice bottom. MMM! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Let’s go full Spanish and put on Rodrigo y Gabriela (yes, we know they are from Mexico, but it’s the vibe we’re looking for). This epic duo makes amazing sounds and they are a blast to see live. Enjoy!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Cascina Luisin’s Minuto family goes back eight generations in Barbaresco, founded by Luigi Minuto in the early 1900s. (Luisin in the local piedmontese means “little luigi”.) In 1952 Liugi’s sons, Lorenzo and Mario, split up the family’s holdings creating what are now two of the most revered estates in Barbaresco: Cascina Luisin by Lorenzo, while Mario began anew with Moccagatta next door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to bottling wines from the Asili and Rabaja crus, which may be the two most acclaimed single vineyards in Barbaresco, Cascina Luisin also farms this special parcel called “Sori Paolin”, which is part of the Basarin cru in the commune of Neive. “Sori Paolin” is the best plot in the steep, sandy, south-facing vineyard. Rising to nearly 900 feet in elevation, these 70-year-old vines produce miniscule amounts of concentrated fruit that possesses all of the qualities found in their better known holdings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On first pop, it’s all summer strawberries and black tea, but within a minute’s swirl in the glass it starts to deepen... kirsch, blood orange, fennel pollen, crushed rose petals and sun-baked clay. The acidity is perfect – mouth-watering and fresh, adding enormous lift to all the aromas and flavors. This is textbook nebbiolo…austere, intense, delicate, and complex, with 15 years or more of pristine growth ahead of it. Utterly delectable to the last sip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the fruit is hand harvested and sorted, with primary fermentation and maceration occurring over 40 days in cement tanks, with frequent racking and re-racking during those first 8 days to ensure a deep extraction of color and intensity, followed by extremely delicate handling for the remaining days, for extraction of what the Minuto clan describes as the “noble tannins” – important for “good development and aging”. Maturation and secondary fermentation are in 30 hl Slovenian barrels for a minimum of two years, followed by 30 months in bottle before release. We don’t have as much as we’d like, so jump all over this beautiful Barbaresco while you can!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: I did this the other day and it worked out perfectly… Hanger Steak Tagliata, served with arugula dressed in lemon juice and olive oil on top of a mound of parmesan polenta. Drizzled a bit of balsamic reduction over all, filled up my biggest glass to mega-pint status and feasted!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: My vote for the greatest live show in Rock ‘n Roll history, The Last Waltz (filmed by a young Martin Scorcese), showcases the profound impact Robbie Robertson and The Band had on rock's greatest era. Enjoy this snippet as the crew performs <em>“The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down”</em>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>It’s been too long, Bandol! We are bouncing off the walls with excitement about this small parcel that just hit the warehouse from the newest rockstar (since 1996) in Bandol, La Begude. THIS PRICE! We had to redo the math several times too, to make sure, but luckily, it’s right! An incredible buy on a wine that is VERY rare to see in our inventory and in the USA for that matter -- please don’t miss it!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was a new discovery from one of our favorite importers, Kysela Pere et Fils, owned and operated by Master Sommelier, Fran Kysela, who always delivers amazing finds. But, this one could top the list!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The property that is now La Begude dates back, staggeringly, to the 7th century, and incredibly old fermentation vessels have been discovered in the ancient cellar walls! Cool! These days, Guillaume and Soledad Tari run the estate and act as ambassadors to help elevate the Bandol appellation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is Mourvedre from one of the great terroirs in the world to grow it -- this vintage is almost 100% (a little Grenache and Cinsault is blended in). The wine is absolutely stunning -- powerful, creamy, fine-grained tannins, but also clean and quite polished for Bandol, which can be a little bit rough and tumble at times. Serious and also pleasing, this wine literally has it ALL, and we bought every single bottle that Fran imported. We've been so excited to unleash this beauty, and today is the day!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Bandol begs for big food and hard cheeses. Do a beef carpaccio with tons of aged parm shaved on top, and/or your favorite meat grilled how you like it. Pepper steak, anyone?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Big! Big sound, big personality...how about some QUEEN? We recently re-watched <em>\"Bohemian Rhapsody\"</em> - what a great movie to watch while drinking this bad boy!</p>",

Dating back to 1902, Germano is classic “old-school” Barolo, with a powerful personality and long-lived (epically long!) structure -- get a few extra for your kids or grandkids! It’s amazing we scored a bit at this price, the vast majority of these wines goes to sommeliers and stay in Europe, snapped up by collectors.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The wine is an experience -- wild rose, macerated cherry, plum jam, black tea, truffles and a hint of cinnamon or chai spice...rich, gripping and one of those incredibly intellectual wines that morphs and changes as you drink it over time, even days! Read a bit more about Germano’s history in the “About” section, but make sure you grab a few of this awesome buy for the cellar...only 22 cases!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Gotta go with cheese here, and preferably some truffles, too. Pick a simple pasta with the best parm or pecorino you can buy to tame the tannins...so good!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Check out Jack White’s new single - <em>\"Taking Me Back\"</em>! </p>",

One of the world’s great wines and profound expressions of Cabernet Sauvignon. The quality of the wines soared to first-growth standards, and have remained there for the last twenty-plus years.” - Robert Parker </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2017 Hillside is simply the best wine produced in the vintage and an absolutely gorgeous wine from start to finish. Always an early site, these south-facing hillside vineyards were fully picked before the fires. There are few wines in the world that can match the consistency and excellence of Hillside Select. Grown on the rocky, volcanic hillsides of the Stag's Leap palisades o the winery 60+ acre estate, the intensity, purity and silky tannins are a signature of this site. </p>\r\n<p>\"The 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon Hillside Select is an insanely beautiful wine. The aromatics alone are pure seduction.\" - Antonio Galloni </p>",

    "description": "<p>Pinot people! This is a project that any serious Oregon pinot lover can get behind -- Douglas and Michelle Ackerman of Armstrong Vineyard, and John Grochau (Erath, Brick House, Grochau and many more). It’s named for the commuter train that ran in the early 20th century through what is now winegrowing paradise. Armstrong Vineyard is 16 acres, planted in 2007, and has been farmed organically since 2013. It’s located in the picturesque AVA of Ribbon Ridge of the Willamette Valley. This is ground zero for world-class pinot with luminaries like Beaux Freres and Patricia Green right next door. Fruit from this vineyard has been used in Ayres, Seven of Hearts, Native Flora and Cameron.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drinking like a Burgundian dream for $25! We suggest tearing open the box the moment it arrives and seeing for yourself! The wine is utterly delicious at $50 -- at half that??!! <em>“Case me!”</em> Wildly perfumey, with lush dark red fruits, black tea, toasted spices and dried herbs, and that all-important line of acidity and minerality from the sedimentary (Willakenzie) soils. The energy and tension here is what takes this wine to the next level, with just fine grained tannins and a long earthy finish. Just 9 barrels were made with native yeasts and about 18% whole cluster fermenation. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agreed! SO GOOD. Will fly out of here at this superb price!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: If you have time, make a Beef Wellington. Pinot LOVES mushrooms, and the mushroom duxelle/truffles that coats the meat in this dish is perfection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Check out the California Honeydrops. Seen them live a few times, and they are a fun, New Orleans-sounding, bluesey band that gets the blood pumping, and they got their start by busking in train stations in Oakland. Check ‘em out wherever you get your tunes!</p>",

    "description": "<p>If you’re new to the wonders of Valpolicella “Ripasso”, here's a quick primer! After their powerhouse Amarone wine is created, the leftover dried grape skins and such (aka pomace) are strained off and added to Valpolicella Classico. This enables the fermenting wine to have richer, spicier, more intense flavors. In the terrific 2018 vintage, you’ll know instantly what we love so much – this just crazy overdelivers!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Three generations of family-run artistry from the hills above Verona define the Magnabosco family, and we are so happy we met them some years ago and started importing their wonderful, soulful wines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This has all the lush, spicy, warming spice flavors of Amarone, but it’s lighter on its feet while packing in so much flavor and nuance. CAUTION --- this is oh-so easy to drink...and keep drinking. We love that it avoids the heaviness of Amarone, and the PRICE TAG! Deep black cherry, sweet tobacco leaf, espresso and toffee, with an array of spices and cinnamon galore, all without being heavy. Wonderful. Delightful. Fresh and instantly happy-making - we promise!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Glazed ham! We got ours from Snake River, and we keep going back to <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/holiday-ham-with-riesling-and-mustard\">this recipe</a> for the crunchy, rich, buttery glaze. Sometimes, we switch it up with Sauternes, or even a little sweet sherry...feel free to mess around with it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Captivate the senses with some of Tom Petty’s greatest hits, like <em>“Mary Jane’s Last Dance\"</em> or <em>\"Refugee\"</em>! You can never go wrong with Valpolicella and Petty.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Quite simply, Paul Bara epitomizes all that is wonderful about old world, hand-crafted Champagne, and a true “grower” Champagne before that was even a thing. First brought to the attention of Americans by beloved importer Kermit Lynch, the house has quickly become THE house in the Bouzy region. We are thrilled to have scored a small parcel at this superb price -- if you’re not already putting some in your cart, that is!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you know, you know, as they say - this is a wine to stock up on for the future and one to enjoy now (we are!). It’s got that beautiful, fine-crafted texture, subtle spices, terrific balance and sense of place. Happy Holidays, indeed!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: We love this wine with smoky/salty ham. We often get a good heritage ham and put it in the smoker for an extra kick, and make a mustard-y sauce with a bit of bubbly or Riesling in the sauce. With potatoes and sides, it’s killer!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Check out the 2020 album called <em>“Rare Changes”</em> by Mayer Hawthorne -- pretty cool vibe and fun bubbly music!</p>",

    "description": "<p>MINER has some of the best terroir on the eastern hills in Oakville, farmed organically by the legendary Phil Coturri. Winemaker Stacy Vogel achieves a supremely balanced 100% Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon sourced from two remarkable and distinct vineyards. The Vyborny Vineyard lends structured, dusty tannins and plenty of dark fruit from this rocky site on the southern border of Oakville. The lush, rich blue fruits in the blend come from Bonny’s Vineyard on the northern border of the Oakville nested appellation, nestled next to the Napa River.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s Cabernet from another planet -- amazing! Will outlive me, for sure. Nose and palate are so fantastically bright and precise, with crushed blackberries and red currants. Terrific, perfectly harmonious, lightly toasted Asian spices and clove, worn, polished leather, and a finish that goes on for a minute! Truly a one-of-a-kind, special occasion buy for serious Napa Valley collectors!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What’s PNV? Premiere Napa Valley wines are the most unique wines made in Napa Valley. The event is a centerpiece of the Napa Valley Vintners, where, for 3-4 days a year, trade members like us get to bid on TINY quantities of very special wines crafted just for this event, that we are able to taste during this short period. Though reminiscent of how <a href=\"https://www.burgundywine.com/Hospice-de-Beaune\">Hospices de Beaune</a> wines are produced in Burgundy, the process is uniquely American. <a href=\"https://premierenapavalley.com/\">HERE’S</a> a good video to further explain, if you like! But know this -- these will not be seen again, EVER! We loved this wine so much we actually submitted this wine for professional review to Owen Bargreen who reviews Washington State for Antonio Galloni's Vinous Media and he gave it a glowing 94 point review, see below. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: It's not just Taco Tuesday - it's taco ANYday. We're craving some al pastor! Spit-grilled pork with chili spices and roasted pineapple...yum! If you're ever in Los Angeles, check out Guerilla Tacos, or any of these places on this <a href=\"https://www.lataco.com/best-al-pastor-adobada-la/\">list!</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: With Dave Miner, owner of Miner Family, being such a music fanatic and quite a talented guitar player, we thought we would do him justice with one of my all-time favorite jazz guitarists, Charlie Christian. Try <em>“Stompin’ At The Savoy”</em> to hear the brilliance of one of the all-time greats.</p>",

    "description": "This wine is a knockout! We were so stoked on this we actually sent this wine in to be reviewed after we bought it. This is classic Beckstoffer magic, with all the cassis, blackberry and dusty black cherry that make these wines some of the best in the Napa Valley. Veteran winemaker Tom Hinde (Lakoyam Cardinale, Verite, Stonestreet, Flowers!) shows off his skillset in this plush, polished and hedonistic cabernet. To our knowledge, it may be one of the first PNV wines to be professionally reviewed! 96 points from Owen Bargreen who reviews Washington State for Vinous Media. Check out his review below, but know that just 60 bottles were produced of this gem. WOW!",

    "description": "<p>Just a few weeks now and we’ll be back in Alba with Mauro to taste all the upcoming vintages...but we’re not ready to stop drinking this beauty (and won’t be anytime in the next two decades!). Wow. So much power and complexity, longevity and length wrapped up in such ethereal weight. So amazing. A MUST. And at our price? Pretty much a no-brainer, while it lasts...</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Manzone Giovanni bought the \"Preve Ciabot\" (the priest's house) in 1925 and acquired the coveted Castelletto and Gramolere vineyards in Monforte, before most of the wine world even knew of Barolo. Today his son, Mauro, is heading up most of the winemaking, and we are so proud to have had a chance meeting with them some years back and have been importing them directly to our Napa warehouse. Since then, they’ve gone on to critical acclaim and allocated wines, but we still get a few cases!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The grapes come from the Castelletto vineyard, located in the Monforte d’Alba cru revered for the power and complexity of the wines produced herein. The vineyard exposure is east-southeast, set amongst clay and calcareous soils on a steep and unforgiving slope. An energetic, powerful wine of tremendous depth – taste dried roses, cherries, dried cherries, balsamic, licorice, orange pekoe tea, currants – all things beautifully polished and fine. This will last for decades! DON’T MISS at our crazy price today!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Yet another reason why fall is my favorite season... MUSHROOMS! Porcinis and chanterelles are popping here in Northern California, and I just can’t get enough. Meaty, umami rich porcinis go especially well with this powerful wine, so make this pasta dish of Tagliatelle with Porcini Mushrooms. I promise, you’ll thank me later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: John Mellencamp and Me’Shell Ndegeocello coming straight from 1994 with this rocking duet <em>\"Wild Night”</em>...that’ll do!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Tenuta Cantagallo (known stateside by the family name, Pierazzuoli, because Gallo has more lawyers than estate vineyards), is a long-time favorite producer of ours. A true family business with two absolutely stunning estates in Chianti. Their “Gioveto” bottling is a best-barrel blend of their prized sangiovese, with chunks of merlot and syrah. This is the best price anywhere for this wine and easily surpasses similar wines at three times the price!</P>\r\n\r\n<p>We know you’re probably a bit worn out hearing us continuing to crow about the 2018 vintage, but...it really does live up to the hype! Pierazzuoli’s ‘18 Gioveto Toscana, with 60% sangiovese, 20% merlot, and 20% syrah is a prime example of the power and grace of the 2018 growing season, harmoniously confined to a wine that will completely exceed your expectations. Dried and super-fresh, bursting with brandied cherry, smoky espresso, blackberry extract, sweet herbs, citrus peel, iron ore – all wrapped up in fine, structured tannins, fresh and tingly acidity and an earthy, mineral-driven finish…just truly astonishing complexity at this price. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pierazzuoli family is a legit old-school producer, making organic wines, raising a few goats and chickens, making some killer organic olive oil, offering a few rooms to stay in, and a little Osteria to eat heartily at. The grapes are grown on rocky, marl soils at elevations from 250-400 meters, with the entirety of the estate being farmed organically. The two brothers, Enrico and Dario, focus on the winemaking and agriculture, while their sisters, Serena and Enrica, run the Osteria and their agro-tourism business – making this one of the most idyllic, self-contained estates you can imagine. We met the family back in 2012 and have kept in touch ever since! You’ll wish you bought more of this as soon as you taste it - this is an incredible value and one of the finest Super Tuscans on this planet, in our opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric Guido, of Vinous, gave the wine a solid 91-point score. While we think that is way lower than the wine deserves, we completely agree with his tasting notes. Read it for yourself and we’re pretty sure that you’ll agree…this sounds like an amazing wine. Trust us…it really is. And only $24.95?!?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Don’t overthink this… this wine goes with SO MANY dishes! My choice, this Campanelle Pasta with Sausage and Brocolli Rabe … Mangia!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Does anyone between the ages of 25 and 55 not immediately think of <em>\"Almost Famous\"</em> when you hear Elton John’s <em>“Tiny Dancer”</em>??? Anywho, killer movie, fantastic song, and the perfect golden god to pair with this wine.</p>",

Because we go back some years now, we import directly from her and have access to a bit more of the prized single-vineyard “Al Carro” than most, and pricing is unbeatable.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Tiziana is making traditional, but terrifically drinkable Brunello di Montalcino (especially in a vintage like ‘15) at her small-yet-gorgeously-perched and rustic winery, and this vintage is deep and dark with lovely overall harmony and mouthfeel, ringing with berries, sweet herbs, a touch of citrus and earth...best Al Carro yet!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read the notes from the pros below. If you’re new to it, this is one to grab while it’s still (somewhat) under the radar, and if you’re one of the folks who asked... BOOM, here you go!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Pasta! If you have a favorite type of spicy sausage, this is the dish to make. Super simple, garlicky, cheesy, spicy and oh-so good with Brunello. Use any pasta, but the local Etruscans would be happy to see you use “pici” as they do in Montalcino and around Siena.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: <em>\"Lawless Soirez</em>” by Gill Landry.</p>",

Classified a 2nd Growth, it has firmly established itself as a \"super 2nd\". It’s also well-known that it was quite the favorite of one Thomas Jefferson, and since being acquired by Chanel, it has only risen in quality and status.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Simply wonderful at this young age - if you prefer your Bordeaux with some youthful energy, this is 100% your jam right now and into the next decade. We loved the crushed flowers, ripe red fruits, black truffles, and the terrific balance so key to enjoying these. Silky, defined, elegant, classy. Don't miss...!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Lamb or beef skewers. Simple, clean, with EVOO, a bit of thyme, S+P, grill and drizzle with more oil. Crumble some good feta or feta-like cheese.

    "description": "<p>We sort of wish it was Thanksgiving again -- this would be just killer with that particular meal for sure. Although honestly, it’s terrific all by itself in our glass as we write this! A cool bottle to have around and straight-up delish!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Laporte is based in Chavignol, a small village in Sancerre that takes great pride in its wines. Laporte happens to be just down the road from one of the most highly regarded producers in all of Sancerre, Francois Cotat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is like Barry White in a pink tux, smooth and seductive. With a salmon color and crisp aromas of white cherry, red berries, stones and flowers...this is all class. The flavors are bright and fresh, with baritone undertones of red berry and mineral that cut the center and leave you ready for your next glass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of that, this is already flying out the door...grab it while it's here!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Got a turkey? Go for it! Although, a perfectly roasted chicken would be amazing with this! Cook it with a bunch of mushrooms and thyme and such, and make a light cream sauce with the drippings. Here’s a <a href=\"https://www.food.com/recipe/le-creuset-french-style-roast-chicken-with-tarragon-cream-sauce-327357\">solid recipe</a> for something along those lines (replace the tarragon with thyme, unless you love it like we do). Perfect with this pinot-based rose!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Dave Grohl covering Van Halen’s <em>“Jump”</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dave-grohl-greg-kurstin-van-halen-jump-hanukkah-sessions-1265736/\">fun one</a> that dropped yesterday. He’s got a whole portfolio of these from the <em>“Hanukkah Sessions”</em>. Google it to find your jam, he’s probably covered it! Or Barry White :)</p>",

    "description": "<p>A serendipitous lunch meeting at Mustards Grill in Yountville began a partnership between Tyler Olbres, a successful designer, and Phillip Corallo-Titus, esteemed winemaker at Chappellet Vineyards for over a quarter century. This is a true hedonistic delight, just beautifully done, in a bottle that weighs about 5 pounds. Napa cab lovers will find an immensely concentrated, seamless, exceptionally crafted wine from some of the finest vineyard sources that money can buy. Andy Beckstoffer (we can't disclose which ones, hint: the good ones) Hirondelle Estate in Stag's Leap, and Broken Rock Ranch on the base of Atlas Peak on the southern border of Stag's Leap. No expenses were spared at any stage of the process and it shows.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The name Nellcote comes from the Chateau where The Rolling Stones recorded <em>“Exile on Main St.”</em> in the Cap Ferret in southern France, just two doors down from where Tyler grew up. The name Rallye 76 is an ode to Tyler's family's rich history of designing luxury cars, primarily for racing at nearby Monaco./p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the rather sudden closing, many of the great wines from the excellent vintages were never rated (there are some out there on back vintages), but we can promise you will be seriously impressed. Silky, concentrated, lavishly rich and mouthcoating, packed with cocoa bean, espresso, blue fruits for days, clove and cola, blackberry essence, violets and a hint of bay leaf...incredibly long and polished, too.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Serious stuff for a SONG, just...wow. FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED, though!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: A beautifully-made beef bourguignon would hit the spot here, with some buttery noodles and some crusty bread and cheese!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Because of the inspiration for the wine name, you HAVE to bump the <em>\"Exile on Main St.\"</em> album! This really is one of the all-time great albums!</p>",

    "description": "<p>We’ve sold Guy Robin’s wines for years, so if you know the producer and you love Premier Cru Chablis, you’ll already be off and grabbing some. If you’re new…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Marie-Ange Robin took the helm of the winery in 2000, she benefitted from her father Guy’s incredible foresight in purchasing a brilliant collection of vineyard plots in Chablis, including parcels in five Grand Crus and four Premier Crus. Because Guy refused to tear up vines for high-yielding clones, as was the practice decades ago in Chablis, some 80% of the family’s vines are considered “old vines”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kimmeridgian soils of the Tonnerre terroir (meaning the fossilization of small sea creatures from the Kimmeridgian era) is a chalky, limestone-rich slope that helps the grapes retain acidity and express a piercingly mineral character that we crave in Chablis. Just to the south and on the same exposition as Grand Cru Blanchots and Les Clos, Montee de Tonnerre (“thunder mountain”) is often thought of as the top Premier Cru site in Chablis and often compared to the Grand Crus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As always, this wine is almost opulent, deeply satisfying with rich, perfumey lemon creme, white stone fruits, orange flower, kaffir lime leaf, crushed rock and oyster shell notes with a satiny, lovely texture. You might think you’re drinking a pricy Puligny! While it lasts...!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: We’d love to drink this with a killer Lyonnaise salad. Here’s a simple <a href=\"https://www.oliviascuisine.com/lyonnaise-salad/\">recipe</a>, but basically you are making a bacon-y salad dressing with mustard over greens and lardons and a poached egg. SO. GOOD!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: We’ve been listening to a lot of X RAY TED – funky beats, mostly instrumental, with old school funk, R+B, and even a little disco sampling. Pretty cool!</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Estate was founded in 1583 when Jean Voisin, a local citizen and eventual mayor of Saint-Émilion, established his residence on a small, preserved, piece of hillside. He quickly identified the terroir quality, as already proven by his illustrious neighbor, Château Figeac, who at the time also owned the parcels that would one day become Château Cheval Blanc and Château Petrus. The vineyard today is an unsegmented parcel surrounding the Château, and tended as 19 individual plots. Each plot of land is farmed differently according to its potential. Merlot comprises 95% of the plantings, with the rest cabernet franc.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The 2018 vintage was a tremendous one for the region, albeit after a difficult start. Downfalls of rain drenched the early clusters of grapes, and significant yield was lost to rot and mildew. What survived was then treated to a very warm and dry summer that offered excellent potential. Voisin’s 30-year-old vines, grown on sandy-clay soil with veins of the region's famous ferrous blue clay, thrived throughout the growing season with excellent water retention and a hillside exposure to minimize rot. This wine is 100% merlot, crafted in conjunction with their premier consultant Hubert de Boüard of Château Angélus, and stands as an absolute achievement.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The wine is texturally rich and supple – like liquid velvet – with black cherry, blackberry compote, plums, Chinese five-spice, licorice, and cigar box and…just so much more. It goes on and on, and at the end of the day, it is simply easy to sip and stare in wonderment as the wine coaxes you down a river of ambrosial lustiness. There’s a lot packed in this wine, and the vintage is the perfect either/or dichotomy. Drink me now, or save me for years and years later, one thing is certain…you will not be disappointed!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>** Fun fact: ancestor Gabriel B. Voisin was an aviation pioneer and manufacturer who turned to making <a href=\"https://www.topspeed.com/cars/car-news/the-1935-voisin-c25-aerodyne-is-the-coolest-car-you-probably-didn-t-know-about-ar189902.html\">luxury automobiles</a> between WW1 and WW2. These iconic and rare vehicles were often chosen by Heads of State and various members of well-off international societal elites. **</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: The texture, the spices, the tremendous unctuousness of this wine all lead me to this… <a href=\"https://www.koreanbapsang.com/galbijjim-korean-braised-beef-short/\">Galbijjim (Korean braised short-ribs)</a> dish. Perfection!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: The meat is braised, the wine is decanted and the evening is just getting started… complete the vibe with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCQfTNOC5aE&feature=youtu.be\">Duke Ellington and John Coltrane getting sentimental</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Halcon was recently sold to Pax Mahle (Wind Gap), but we worked some magic and snagged a few more cases of the 94-point blockbuster Chateauneuf-look-alike, “Esquisto”! This is the last vintage from Paul and Jackie Gordon, and these wines will be sorely missed, as they remain some of the finest values in California wine, period. How are these wines so good at this price?? If you know, you know, and are already putting a 6-pack in your cart, are we right? This is the absolute last we’ll see of them, please hurry!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Yorkville Highlands, in the cool rolling hills on your way out to the Northern CA coast and at the gateway to Anderson Valley, is an EXCEPTIONAL place to grow Rhone varietals, and Halcon is quite simply the best by a mile. Many industry insiders consider Halcon Vineyard to be home to the very best syrah in all of California, and we’re not going to dispute that. The Gordons had bought the land, set at 2,500 feet elevation — very high for a California vineyard — with rolling, uneven slopes, fast, whipping winds, and cool temperatures. The site is even blanketed in winter snow for some years. These soils are made of rocky, immensely rare (for California) blueschist (\"Esquito\" means \"schist\" in Spanish). Yields here are meager, producing small berries that look like something out of the best vineyards in Northern Rhone. While the altitude, slopes, wind, and cold can make farming here difficult, the resulting wines emphasize deeply savory attributes with a pronounced mineral edge.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>This cool and energetic wine may easily remind you of an $80 bottling from Usseglio or Marcoux! In fact, do as we and other savvy Halcon fans often do, and put it in a blind tasting of Rhones and see the guesses…you’ll be amazed by how much these beauties overdeliver. Gorgeously polished, roaring with cherries, incense, lavender, kirsch and mint….a knockout at this price…honestly we couldn’t come up with a better deal when it comes to domestic Rhone blends…HALCON is king! But we’re guessing you already know that! 80% grenache, 20% syrah, with half the wine fermented whole cluster, this is just an immense delight to drink. While it lasts…!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Breakout your favorite chili recipe… the depth of spice, the savory richness, the earthy, smoky warmth of piping hot mouthfuls…it all just works. Texans will say chili can’t have beans, but we say pshaw to that… go on and add those beans (and roasted poblanos, cubes of beef with the ground, and whatever else seems like a good idea at the time!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Led Zeppelin rocks… no one can debate that. But Bluegrass? Listen to <em>“Bron-Y-Aur Stomp”</em> and tell me that’s not bluegrass. It still rocks, though.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Normally $40! Domaine Blachon is a Saint-Joseph benchmark since before WW1, and the fifth generation is making its finest wines ever! Wonderful freshness with deep, complex, mouthcoating flavors in this bottling...amazing price!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>We’re extremely picky when it comes to Rhone whites in general, and MAN did this hit all the sweet spots for us! Two classic varietals at play here – 95% marsanne and 5% roussanne. Where one lacks, the other shines, and vice versa. It’s a familiar blend that has been a standard for centuries: marsanne makes a structured, full-bodied wine with a waxy texture, but lacks aromatic intensity, where roussanne is light on texture but provides lovely aromas of pear, honeysuckle, with some herbal qualities.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>We love the pure freshness and complexity in this cuvee, fermented in concrete and then just a short elevage in large old barrels. Get ready! Sliced toasted almonds, lavender honey, dried apricot, rich and layered and terrifically long and heady. Wow! Pour me another!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: You HAVE to have shellfish here, the richer the better! Fresh sweet shrimp, lobster, scallops and rich fish like sea bass, too. You’ll want a butter sauce to dip or pour over, and, at our house, fried potatoes! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: We like the unfussy tunes and profoundly expressive, diverse voice of Ray LaMontagne for this wine -- puts us in a happy, mellow, peaceful mood!</p>",

    "description": "<p>We love this wine with unbridled enthusiasm (and the head-spinning price, of course!). We can’t wait to gush bout it, so here’s a few highlights:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Nose: Exotic Spice Rack, Perfume, Mineral</p>\r\n<p>- Gorgeous, Precise and High-Toned Aromas</p>\r\n<p>- Black Cherry, Sweet Herbs, Tobacco Leaf, Sandalwood</p>\r\n<p>- Super Floral</p>\r\n<p>- Violets and More Violets, Lavender, Pastille, Earth</p>\r\n<p>- Very Mineral, hints of Savory</p>\r\n<p>- Palate: A Super Elegant St. Joseph Despite Its Ripeness</p>\r\n<p>- Juicy Black Fruits, Dense, Ripe, more Mineral and Spice</p>\r\n<p>- Dark Fruited, But So Utterly Fresh and Vivid</p>\r\n<p>- Super Fine and Lingering Tannins</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Located in Mauves, the tenderloin of the sprawling appellation, Domaine Blachon is all about location. These steep, terraced hillside vineyards overlook the Rhone river and produce classic expressions of Syrah. The Blachons have been bottling Syrah since before World War I from their exemplary and archetypal vineyards. Roger Blachon took on responsibility for his parents' vines in the 1970s. Roger refocused on staying regional and producing small batches of premium quality wines. Roger passed away in 2006, and the estate transitioned to his children, Delphine and Sylvain, who are the 5th generation of inspiring vignerons carrying on his legacy. They created today’s wine “Cuvee Hommage Roger Blachon” in his honor.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>No reviews to support our enthusiasm here, but trust us, this is an incredible deal! $119.70 a six pack with ground shipping included! Dont miss...!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Lamb chops are perfect, of course. <a href=\"https://tablascreek.com/recipes/pomegranate_lamb_chops\">Here</a> is a good recipe that adds a bit of an Asian touch to it, which is fun with all the rich, peppery, awesome Syrah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Why not listen to a podcast about Saint-Joseph? The legendary Jean Gonon talks to Levi Dalton on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/3mgEyhfSWkFheILDWrvUe7?si=f886f02759e34ceb&nd=1\">this podcast</a>.

    "description": "<p><em>\"I was again very impressed with the quality I found and the domain just seems to continue to go from strength to strength.\"</em> - Allen Meadows, Burghound.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Indeed! Aligote is hot these days, and you can’t get a much better intro than Colin’s. Old vines (some dating back up to a century in the family) and organic farming give this crisp, fascinating white a charming, subtle minty and sweet herb-like note, with tons of exotic lemon and yuzu flavors, a cool saltiness, ultra-fresh and delicious. 5 months in used oak.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Marc Colin’s father, Pierre, planted these vines in the spring of 1946 in the lieu-dit of “La Combe” in Puligny-Montrachet. Severe pruning, horse-by-plow, and organic fertilizers keep their vines fit, giving wine of spiral depth and flavor. In the words of Damien and Caroline: <em>“This wine captures what our grandfather and father taught us: small quantity, high quality and reflects its sense of place in La Combe. We seek fruit, energy and nerve. Aromas of white flower and of course our beloved wild fennel, typical of the varietal. Our low yields and only natural acidity produce a lengthy mouth feel.”</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You WILL love it – as long as it lasts!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: A simple roast chicken with lemon and thyme is ideal, but try something different! In Burgundy, many a winemaker will say Aligote is fantastic with lemongrass, so try a Thai or Laotian dish with lemongrass, or make an easy one yourself <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/pounded-lemongrass-chickenher\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Bob Mould was the man behind post-punk band Husker Du – check out another project he had called Sugar. Try <em>“Favorite Thing”</em> first.</p>",

He assembles his own wines under his signature by adding a touch of modernity to the sincere expression of the Rhone terroirs. Xavier is a man who knows the terroirs of the southern Rhone Valley as well as anyone in the world, and with his massive roster of all-star clients that he consults for, it is no wonder how wines like this are possible.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>L'Esprit Français Vendémiaire II is a non-vintage blend of 70% grenache, 20% syrah, 10% mourvedre, and drinks fantastically right out of the gate. Sun-drenched blue fruits galore, clear, pure cassis notes, bright, yet dark, rich, and satisfying, with plenty of spice from old-vine grenache, pepper and sweet strawberries. So GOOD and made from organic grapes.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<p>On the last few cases...while it lasts!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Tacos. Not exactly French, of course, but so good with this fun red. Asada, pastor - you pick it, just load up with them! A queso fundido would be a much-recommended addition, too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: The Beach Boys' <em>“Kokomo”</em> is one of the goofiest songs ever, but seems just right for this wine and those tacos...</p>",

    "description": "<p>When you are looking for truly age worthy, classically styled Napa Valley cab, look no further than the Napa icon, Larkmead. These wines are so harmonious, lush, yet precise, finely tuned, and structured. This legendary property has been making great wines for years, but MAN! This ‘18 is truly fantastic! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the center of Larkmead’s genius is the remarkable diversity of soils (and the fact that they own an incredible swath of vineyards that are ideally situated). Centuries of alluvial flow have resulted in the accumulation of ancient riverbed gravel, clay, and loam. Located just north of St. Helena, the winery first began in 1895, and is still family-owned today by Cam and Kate Solari Baker. Then there’s Dan Petroski (Google him!) -- a master winemaker and one of the coolest, mellowest, wine-loving guys we know, who makes incredibly fine wines from the vineyard, along with his own label, Massican.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We just fell for this wine on first whiff with sandalwood, sage, cassis, spice and everything nice. The real magic is once it hits your lips, there is cool currant and pencil shavings, with almost mountain grown structure and tannic power that hints at the long evolution that this wine surely has in front of it. We have a particularly compelling price on this...while supplies last!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: For us? A Charter Oak (in St. Helena) burger. Smashburger (2 patties), thin, crispy, salty, with real American cheese and a bit of roasted pepper. So hedonistic. Gotta love a simple burger with a big young Napa Cab!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: <em>“Santa Monica”</em> by Everclear. Yeah, it’s old, but you can’t help to rock out and scream along with it!</p>",

    "description": "<p>\"Rita and Clemens Busch are long establishing the organic domain among the finest Riesling producers in all of Germany.\" - Stephan Reinhardt, Robert Parker's Wine Advocate </p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<p>This Riesling is EPIC. We are SO lucky to get a few cases of the Terrassen Grosses Gewachs (GG) every year - it’s like winning the lottery!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“A giant…ripeness, richness and power are perfectly interwoven” - Wine Advocate</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh man, THAT is the truth. If you know Clemens, you KNOW. If not, hurry…it gets snapped up by savvy Riesling aficionados lightning-quick!! “Crystalline” is the word most commonly ascribed to Clemens & Rita Busch’s wines, and the new Marienburg Fahrlay “Terrassen” is a true, deer-in-the-headlights KNOCK-out. LITERALLY lip-smacking, it’s so pure and fine and otherworldly, you will wonder why you drink anything else! You all flipped for the “regular” Fahrlay GG we sold last month (and sold out of in hours), but you are not ready for the suped-up “terraced” version from ungrafted vines that are over one hundred years old! It is certified bangin’!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Organic. Biodynamic. Natural. And pioneers in moving Germany in this direction. No one else on the Mosel makes wines like these - they’re unique, contemplative and riveting and have gained quite a following, not to mention their extreme rarity! The grapes for the Terrassen cuvée are harvested on the steepest terraces of the Fahrlay grand cru, a volcanic formation of blue slate that is hundreds of millions of years old. We’ll leave with one more quote from the Wine Advocate:</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p><em>“The wines are authentic, expressive and have an inimitable identity that represents the particular origin of which the terraced parts with the often ungrafted vines can give unforgettable drinking experience. These are not wines to enjoy quickly or even thoughtlessly. I'd rather recommend to drink them slowly, not too cool and with all the time they need and you are ready to give them.\"</em> - Stephan Reinhardt, Robert Parker's Wine Advocate</p>",

Anyone following this estate knows how tremendous recent vintages have been. Pulling for three distinct areas of Saint-Emilion, Franc Mayne perfectly expresses the appellation and its diverse solid types of limestone, clay, sand and marl.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This wine is pretty freaking spectacular if we do say so ourselves. Deep purple and aromatically explosive with blueberry, blackberry, black raspberry, chocolate and a myriad of florals - white, red and violets. While dark and deeply extracted, it is simultaneously light on its feel, quite mineral, fine and elegant. The flavors are brilliantly clean, and pure with red plum, blackberry, black raspberry and spice nuances.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Young St. Emilion can be a little...HUGE in their youth, but Franc Mayne's new release bucks that. It’s so fun and balanced and silky-rich. While it lasts...!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: So good with a seared pork chop, with mushrooms (morels if you are feeling spendy), all basted up in butter and miso and a bit of soy and hoisin.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: An oldie but a goodie - “Lawyers, Guns and Money” by Warren Zevon!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Diego Conterno, the newest Conterno on the rise in a big way, just hit the warehouse (well, all 20 cases of it!). The ‘17 is serious juice and wildly well-priced in the luxury world of Barolo! 94 POINTS!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>“Conterno’s 2017 is ALL CLASS”</em> - Vinous</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certified organic since 2014, with vineyards in the Monforte d’Alba commune (the Ginestra cru, specifically), these are for the Barolo traditionalist, generally, with long, cool fermentations, medium-weight, floral and spiced aromatics, and hefty structure for the long-term. No new oak or over-extraction, just classically proportioned nebbiolo. We feel VERY lucky to have gotten on the Diego Conterno train early, yes indeed!</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Certainly, the bar is high with a name like Conterno. Diego, being from the Conterno-Fantino side of the family and a protégé of the legend Beppe Colla of Prunotto. After a couple of decades making wines for Conterno-Fantino, Diego decided to go at it on his own. We just love his style (and the price!) – a perfect wine to savor a bit now, and definitely cellar into 2040 or so!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Ahhhh, just thinking about this dish makes my mouth water. When we were in Piedmont a few months ago, we had Vitello Tonnato on a couple of different occasions, a surprising match for Nebbiolo and a dish that is so authentically Piedmontese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Check out Dan Reeder for a musical breath of fresh air. Cue up his \"Havana Burning\" from his early works or check out \"Maybe\" from his record This New Century. </p>",

    "description": "<p><em>“Three be the things I shall never attain: Envy, content, and sufficient champagne.”</em> -- Dorothy Parke. Magnums! As you all know, bubbly is ALWAYS better in large format, and our amazing direct-imported price makes it even sweeter.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The perennial killer Premier Cru bubbly called “Eminence” from Berthelot hails from vineyards the wineries vineyards in Dizy and Avenay, and they’ve been doing it since 1940. In the last handful of years however, Berthelot has really hit their stride. This new release is made entirely from the warm, lush 2016 vintage, and it just gets our motors running big time -- so much stone-fruity energy, candied lemon peel, packed Asian pear and croissant dough, a touch of mint and lychee with toasted apples on the finish...so GOOD! It’s built from mostly pinot noir, with 30% chardonnay with a 5.25 gram dosage. If you don’t love this stuff, we want it back!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: We’re making veal piccata tonight (or do chicken or fish even, if you like) with all that wonderful caper-y briney-ness – it’s perfect with this toasty bottle of bubbly goodness. Here’s an easy <a href=\"https://www.thespruceeats.com/classic-veal-piccata-recipe-995302\">recipe</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: New discovery for us, on the “surf tunes” side of things: check out Messer Chups <em>“Pink Pantheratu”</em>, pretty cool…!</p>",

    "description": "<p>In a vintage that Wine Spectator has rated higher than any other in Napa Valley history, the 2018 Accendo was only outscored by a single wine, the MacDonald Oakville Cab. That is high praise indeed, scoring the same as legends like Dalla Valle Maya, Dominus, Colgin, Schrader and Eisele. When it comes to Antonio Galloni's Vinous Media, he also waxed poetically on the greatness of the vintage and dolled out eight one-hundred point wines, Accendo being one, which he actually gave 100-points to, not once, but two different times! He went on to call it <em>“...clearly one of the wines of the vintage”.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A treasure for the cellar…as long as we have it!</p>",

    "description": "<p>DETHUNE. We are fairly sure we were among the earliest retailers in the U.S. to latch onto the greatness over a decade ago – luckily, we still get a pretty cool allocation even with the rest of the world on board now!! Not many of these wines are made every year, and we fight to keep our allocation coming every year. But now, everyone else knows and we struggle to get much of an allocation at all! In fact, Decanter World Wine Awards, one of the world's most rigorous and lauded blind tasting competitions awarded the Brut version of this wine 97 points from this same disgorgement! In fact, the only difference from this wine and the 97 pointer is that this wine has a dosage of 3.5 grams fewer, otherwise it is the exact same wine!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p> Just landed is the gorgeous, massively delicious and satisfying Grand Cru BdB Extra Brut. The first ever low dosage cuvee from Dethune! HOW is this so good? WHY is it not $125?! Don’t ask. Just get 6 or more - put 3 in front to drink NOW, and stash 3 for the holidays.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>This cuvee is 100% pinot noir and is vinified in 205 liter Champagne oak barrels in the family cellars, which were cut out of the chalk in the 17th century. The insider tip: (*whispers quietly*) this is a blend of almost entirely single-vineyard Les Crayeres, one of the most coveted single-vineyards in all of Champagne! This is the same base cuvee as the 95 point scoring Brut, just with a few grams less sugar and it is better for it. </p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>This fills the room with a wonderful lime, shortbread and tonic-like aroma right off the bat, delicate croissant crust and a dash of vanilla toast, and carries it to the palate with a wave of rich, sensual texture. There is always remarkable salinity that take these wines to the next level. The balance and forwardness of Dethune is always remarkable, and a second glass is mandatory! Just the right complexity, generous personality, and amazingly long finish.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>One of the best young wines from Dethune we’ve ever tasted! Could easily cost so much more...all we can say is GRAB SOME, we only got 25 cases!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: We know it’s cliché, but man, fried chicken is SO GOOD with a lush, happy style like this. Don’t do any crazy pickle juice brine or anything, go classic buttermilk and use peanut oil. Oh, and some honey butter will not hurt anything either!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: For whatever reason, we’ve been cranking up this old R.E.M. tune — it needs to be wall-shaking loud — <em>“Finest Worksong”</em> — and sing along at the top of your lungs!</p>",

Like his great-grandfather Léon, his grandfather Henri and his father Paul, Pierre is tracing his own path… in the heart of the grassy wine country of Ambonnay. They do the demanding job of Grower-Producers, following a stringent sustainable development approach. As regards the line that came before them and the one that extends ahead, the couple consider themselves to be a generational relay of a timeless heritage. With quality and respect for people and the environment, they produce a range of seven champagnes that are 100% Grand Cru."

    "description": "<p>Over the years, we’ve been lucky to sell a bit of Testamatta, but magnums are a first, especially at this fine price. I’m guessing most of you savvy oenophiles need no introduction to Bibi’s wines, but there's a huge raft of scores and info below if you need a refresher! PERFECTION in magnums...we’re just stunned!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>100% sangiovese, of course, as always, 50+ year old vines, made at his medieval castle, Castello di Vincigliata overlooking Florence. Bibi is an icon, self-taught and one of the early “cult” winemakers in Tuscany. He has a reputation of being Italy’s most talented and interesting winemakers. The labels are all personally drawn by Bibi Graetz, with the help from his daughter who both come from a long line of talented visual artists. Bibi is able to combine both of his passions into an amazing masterpiece. The wine in this vintage is five stars with wine publications predicting that this vintage will fall between the lavish 2015s and extravagant 2016s. Don't miss</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Try something more traditionally Florentine. Did you know they do crepes in Tuscany? Yup – check this out – crespelle alla Fiorentina. Hard to go wrong with ricotta and bechamel, are we right? Here’s a <a href=\"https://www.italymagazine.com/recipe/crespelle-alla-fiorentina\">recipe</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Checked out the new Eddie Vedder album yet? <em>\"Earthling\"</em> is growing on us, check it out. The opening track <em>\"Invincible\"</em> is a great vibe for some world-class sangiovese!</p>",

Not to mention more accessible for drinking earlier! Roero’s landscape – with its rolling hills, steep vineyards and unique sandy soils – produces some of Italy’s most intriguing wines, and PELASSA is at the top of the list!!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Dating back to 1960, Pelassa has become a quiet “insider” nebbiolo producer that those in the know scoop up whenever they can. US TOO! The Riserva is singing with bright sweet red fruits, rich yet soft tannin, and a surprisingly complex, layered flavor profile, with mineral and spicy components. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n <p>Awesome juice + PRICE! While it lasts...!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Fantastic with a garlic-laden, roasted tomato pasta dish — use grilled shrimp, or sausage, or a mess of grilled veggies like zucchini or squash, even, with a generous grating of parmesan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: <em>“Kick Out The Jams”</em> by The Presidents of the United States gets your blood flowing!</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Chateau, itself a stone’s throw away from the legendary Chateau Ausone (this wine is typically $1000 or so!), is led by winemaking prodigy Stephane Derenoncourt, utilizes organic farming, and is basically making the best wines of its long history! </p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Still a baby, of course, but after a quick decanting, this is ethereally powerful and rich, with intense layers of flavor and secondary notes – just a “wow” wine any way you slice it. The 50% new oak is something we appreciate, too – it lets the gorgeous ripe fruit shine in this excellent Right Bank vintage. About 20 cases just landed direct from Bordeaux…please grab a few at this killer price while we have it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: We’re already planning a dinner around this bottle, and this is going to be the main nosh: pork belly buns. We found a fantastic recipe over the weekend – <a href=\"https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/steamed-bacon-buns-hoisin\">here it is</a> – Steamed Bacon Buns with Hoisin. Hedonistically awesome!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: We’re in a Chris Stapleton mood, as of late. Check him out on your fave music platform and get in the groove!</p>",

Drink up!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TerraNoble is a relatively new find for us, and WHOA, were we impressed! The winery is famed for its world-class carmenere, but the pinot is our jam, oh yes! Aged in concrete eggs and older French oak barrels, it's completely fruit-focused with that Burgundian \"sous bois\" or forest floor, with a laser beam of raspberry and sweet Marasca cherry, baking spice and savory elements, and that much sought-after tang of minerality. Fresh and long and simply irresistible drinking! Pinot lovers, this will rock your world!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is a serious score — take advantage while we have! There are only 35 cases...!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Take chicken thighs and brush them with honey, soy, ginger, garlic, a bit of hoisin if you have, and bake them in the oven at 400. When they are done, crank up the broiler, brush a bit more glaze on, and get the skins all crispy. Dinner!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: The Red Hot Chili Peppers have a new album out – <em>“Unlimited Love”</em> – check it out!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Super limited. Just 8 cases, and sure to go quickly. The incredibly fresh Baker & Hamilton wine hails from the Phillips family’s beautiful Oakville property on the east side of Oakville, near Dominus ($300), Promontory ($900), Beckstoffer Missouri Hopper (which was part of VHR in the past), and Harlan Estate ($1000+) to name a few. The vineyard’s early stewards were Bob and Alex Phillips, whose dad bought the vineyard in 1959 and made it one of Napa Valley’s unheralded stars. Today, it has reached ELITE status alongside the very best vineyards in all of Napa Valley.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Baker & Hamilton was created with a bit more focus on select retailers and restaurants. It’s made in the same exact way as the $300 VHR, just sourced from the lower and slightly cooler part of the vineyard. THAT’S A GOOD THING. The wine soars with excellent blue fruit - amazingly lush, full, and delineated, with a vaguely “old school” Napa note of cedar and tobacco...we LOVED it. It’s a STEAL with all this pedigree, too – did we mention the winemaker is Françoise Peschon – a longtime winemaker for Araujo Estate who trained at Château Haut-Brion? Throw in a nod to tenured vineyard master Michael Wolf (Harlan), and you have an absolute can’t miss! Grab a couple of bottles and you won’t regret it!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Don’t overthink this. Get a killer meat or mushroom pie. Make your mom’s meatloaf. Make meatballs or bolognese or cacio e pepe or a hangar steak. Make a burger. This is young, silky, delicious Napa cab — just do what comes naturally!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: We hung out with the leader of the Dandy Warhols the other night (dude loves his Bordeaux and Napa cab!), so why not crank it up! <em>“Bohemian Like You”</em> is a good start, then graduate to <em>\"Horse Pills\"</em> and <em>\"Be-In\"</em> and many more.",

    "description": "Vignariodnda is one of Serralunga's most prized vineyards. It is packed with active limestone, in fact, it is the highest concentration of active limestone in all of Barolo! The soils are grey marl and sandstone that are rich in microelements which give these wines their staggering complexity. This also gives the wine its beautiful acid and intense, well-integrated tannins. In warm vintages like 2017, sites like this are able to temper the ripeness and create wines that will age for decades. This wine is massively structured but also ripe and appealing young. It is a wine that when enjoyed young, should be decanted for several hours or cellared for at least 5 years. A stellar showing from one of our favorite producers.",

If this was hailing from Tuscany, you’d be paying 2 to 3 times the price, easily!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The ‘18 Rivarossa is a blockbuster, packed with black cherries, black plums, bright sweet red fruit, cigar box and sweet tobacco leaf, with silky, warming tannins and finishing with a whiff of mocha and spices...absolutely rocking delicious! Aged 15 months in large used oak, with an extra year in bottle before release, we picked up this parcel a few months back from our connection in Italy and it has just hit the warehouse.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>What else can we say...? DON’T MISS! What a treat!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: PIZZA. There’s so much good pizza to play with for this wonderful red. Try rosemary ham, or chorizo, or maitake mushrooms, or burrata cheese…whatever you’re feeling!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: For my friends in Louisiana, crank up <em>“Callin’ Baton Rouge”</em> by Garth Brooks - country lover or not, it’s a good one!</p>",

Minimalist winemaking, native ferments, little to no sulfur and the refusal to chaptalize are the tenants that make this winery what it is, they have just been doing far before it was the \"cool\" thing to do. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2020 Moulin-a-Vent Trois Roches is a stunning wine of purity and refinement with a wild flare of herbs and roasting agave alongside cassis and black raspberry. These are among the top wines made in the vintage in the region, drink it now or over the next two decades, yes, really!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Jean-Etienne Chermette has once again produced a superb range of wines at this southern Beaujolais reference point...To my palate, some of the cuvées reviewed here number among the finest values that can be found in French wine, and I warmly recommend any readers who haven't yet acquainted themselves with this estate to try a few bottles.\" - Robert Parker's Wine Advocate</p>",

    "description": "<p>As part of our annual pilgrimage to Italy last year, we visited Fabio’s new winery just outside the village of Montalcino and tasted many a barrel sample with his winemaker. ONE, in particular, was raised 100% in amphora – 6-8 months, in fact, from grapes grown on the warmer side of the appellation - Castelnuovo dell'Abate. Fermented with indigenous yeasts, this is a wonderful expression of sangiovese – pure, mineral, complex and driving with pure red fruits.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>We can’t say enough about this rare bottling – Brunello purists and the sangiovese-curious should DEFINITELY grab a few. We added about 120 bottles on with our regular Brunello order... That’s all we could get!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Stay simple with a brick-cooked chicken. We like the “airplane” cut (breast and thigh) - just marinate a bit with EVOO and salt, etc. – skin-side down with a heavy pot on top, get a good sear, flip over, do it again. That’s all this pure, zesty wine wants to shine!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Iggy Pop’s <em>“Candy”</em> has been going around in our heads this morning – crank it up!</p>",

Must be that fantastic property, the genius-level winemaking (Negly has too many 95-100 point scores to count) from Claude Gros, to name a few things! Beautifully polished, fresh, zesty yet powerful with deep curranty fruit, spices, wild herbs and sweet oak (judiciously done) and just a touch of olive and mocha, too. SO GOOD - 60% syrah, 30% grenache, 10% mourvedre.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Chateau was built in the 18th century and was originally named d'Anceley, and in 1807, the name changed to Negly. Many families have owned this historic estate over the centuries, but it wasn't until the arrival of Jean Paux-Rosset, who purchased Negly in 1992, that the wines produced from these old traditional vineyards began their elevation to premier level status.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>We just received our tiny allocation and all we can say is – GO! Plenty of press to read up on here, just know you are getting beautifully polished and concentrated wine with fantastic levels of complexity for pretty much ANYTHING priced like this!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Lamb chops. Plan for a day of cooking (2 hours, really) with this <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/french-in-a-flash-grilled-lamb-chops-port-syrup-garlic-confit-sauce-vierge-persillade-recipe\">recipe</a>. Garlic confit is simply amazing, you can use it over and over too. Classic complements to syrah-based red with the rosemary, too – delicious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: We also saw Greta Van Fleet during Bottle Rock weekend, and let me tell you, they’re one of my new favorites! Blast any of their tunes - it's bound to eliminate those Sunday scaries!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Wow! Perfect all-the-time red drinking (at our price, especially!), we cannot keep our hands off this delicious bottling - it's a 2016 people - the association vintage of the century in Chateauneuf. The way this flows with pure red goodness, strawberry, raspberry, kirsch and red apple, lush, yet precise and totally focused on the fruit and the secondary garrigue-y spices. Just awesome!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Laurent Brechet has lovingly resurrected this noble domaine and established it as one of the most forward and terroir driven properties in the region. The property sits at a junction of the main soil types found in Châteauneuf. Decomposed sandstone, red clay-limestone, and galets (rolled stones) are all present, giving a broad palette of terroir to work with.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Just read the (many!) glowing reviews below, but do it quickly... We’re wishing we had more, for sure!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: We had the BEST mushroom dumplings this weekend, and they’d be extra fantastic with this wine, we think. Try this <a href=\"https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/chinese-mushroom-dumplings/\">recipe</a> or order them from your fave place (ours was “Lo + Behold” in Healdsburg).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Check out the California Honeydrop’s new single: <em>“Get Real High”</em>!",

Stu Lerner was a highly successful pallet maker - enough so to purchase 91 acres of which 13 acres are planted almost entirely to cabernet sauvignon (clone 6), along with a tiny block of malbec. They were planted by none other than Dick Steltzner in 1983. He hired rockstar Russell Bevan, and is quietly becoming the “insider” cab for those in the know.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bevan fans will know the vineyards in this blend – a barrel selection of fruit sources from two of Russell’s favorite vineyard sites, including Tench Vineyards in Oakville and Sugarloaf (it is worth noting that both Tench and Sugarloaf consistently score between 96-100 points). This year's blend is almost exclusively Tench (yeah, that vineyard adjacent to Screaming Eagle in Oakville!), and it is a total barnburner. If you like subtle, elegant wines, then DELETE this email, because today’s offer is a massive, no-holds-barred, uber-concentrated cabernet with incredible polish and fruit purity.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>** We have just a few cases! ** First come, first served…!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Stir-fried flank steak with yellow onions – perfect.

One of the world’s great wines and profound expressions of Cabernet Sauvignon...The quality of the wines soared to first-growth standards, and have remained there for the last twenty-plus years.” - Robert Parker </p>\r\n\r\n<p>These wines, from the quiet masterwork winemaking of Elias Fernandez (truly, one of the greatest people and winemakers in the Valley), remain rock-solid, polished, powerful and beautifully well-made wines in the entire Valley, year after year. The new wines are here and the Relentless just crushes it this year. 96-98 points and one of the most compelling versions of this wine (to my palate) since the legendary 2008 which earned the Wine of the Year honors from Wine Spectator almost a decade ago. More peppercorn, minerality and Cote Rotie-like complexity than ever before in the wine, WOW! This is also a bit lighter on its feet than previous vintages with extreme polish and beautiful balance. It's as classy as they come and a wine that should age gracefully for decades.",

    "description": "<p><em>“One Point Five remains one of Napa Valley's little hidden gems; a wine that is seldom talked about in a discussion of the very top bottlings, but a Cabernet that never disappoints.”</em> - Antonio Galloni, Vinous</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>id John Shafer know, back in 1972, that his cabernet would become one of the most collectible, critically-acclaimed Napa wines ever when he planted his vineyard in Stags Leap? We have a TINY allocation (at nice pricing) of the excellent One Point Five bottling (less than half the price of Hillside, and preeeeetty close in quality!). You’ll WANT this to drink for a few years while your Hillside ages a few more, am I right?</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>- 83% cabernet sauvignon, 12% merlot, 3% malbec, 2% petit verdot</p>\r\n<p>- Predominantly from two Stags Leap District sites — Shafer’s hillside estate vineyard and the “Borderline” vineyard located about two miles south of the winery</p>\r\n<p> - 20 months in 100% new French oak barrels (Allier & Tronçais)</p>\r\n \r\n<p>200% incredibly sexy and powerful and utterly captivating, too! We like winemaker Elias’ words: <em>“2019 One Point Five fills your glass with a generous, opulent Cabernet Sauvignon offering aromas and flavors of bright black cherry, red currant, cranberry, lavender, allspice, and crushed herbs. All this lush, vivid fruit is seamlessly brought together with ripe, cashmere-like tannins that promise years of beauty ahead with careful cellaring.”</em></p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Be sure to check out the critic’s notes on this...this is one of those times where their praise seems to go even above and beyond the already fantastic scores! But, fair warning, just a handful of cases...and another fantastic, over-delivering Napa classic from your Napa buds at First Bottle! First come, first served, good people!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Go with a killer cheese/meat plate. We recommend <a href=\"https://www.tienda.com/jamon/?gclid=CjwKCAjw9LSSBhBsEiwAKtf0n0gjTx8_qFQrezmrThPoMlzvabaN0z3SZg5379xBoC7DFPxXXrBwyhoCV9kQAvD_BwE\">Iberico ham</a> – get the best. And the cheese — Comte, if you can find it, is amazing. Or do as the Bordelais do and try a ripe, creamy Brie type that you can eat with a spoon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: We’ve been listening to some old Smithereens - we’d recommend <em>“Only a Memory”</em>, <em>“House We Used To Live In”</em>, and <em>“Sorry”</em> to start!",

    "description": "<p><em>“Year in year out, this is one of the superstar wineries, not only in Napa Valley and all of California, but in the entire world.”</em> - Robert Parker, Jr.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p><em>“Shafer is one of Napa Valley's best oiled machines. Year after year the wines deliver the goods in a rich, sumptuous style that defines the very essence of contemporary Napa Valley at its very best.”</em> -Antonio Galloni</p>\r\n<p>Doug Shafer, son of his visionary father John (who took Nathan Fay’s advice in 1978 and planted cabernet in the Stag's Leap District), has led Shafer to new heights, being dubbed one of the <em>\"greatest wineries in the world\"</em> by the most important wine critic in the world, Robert Parker. We guarantee you’ll agree upon tasting this new release, they are producing the best wines in their storied history.</P>\r\n\r\n <p>The 2019 is a head-turner, packed with brooding blue/purple fruits, creme de cassis, rich holiday spices, baking spice and an incredibly velvety and polished texture. A classic blend of 55% cabernet sauvignon, 33% merlot, 8% malbec, 4% petit verdot from three distinct sites, including Stag’s Leap District and winemaker Elias Fernandez aged this in 100% new Allier and Troncais barrels. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We love it. We had a little less this year, so move quickly...!</P>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: We don’t do this often, but...meatloaf. It’s one of those super-homey things that warms the soul, as does this bottling from Shafer. We like to fancy it up with a few things like bacon or prosciutto, and the rich chicken stock does wonders too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: <em>“Buddy”</em> by Tim Heidecker. We all had a friend like that…</p>",

Antonio Galloni just broke it wide open… </p>\r\n\r\n<p>96-point Diamond Mountain cabernet sauvignons are rare, but at this price… we don’t think any other wine even comes close! Case in point, a quick dive into the interwebs will show that Antonio Galloni also rated a few other Diamond Mountain cabernets at 96 points in 2018… Lokoya ($449), Diamond Creek’s Volcanic Hill ($299), and The Vineyardist’s Heritage Ridge ($275)! Those are absolutely stellar wines, no doubt, but ponder this… by taking advantage of our three bottle pricing, you can get three bottles of this amazing Dyer cabernet for less than the least expensive, single bottle of these competitors. Puts things in perspective, doesn’t it?</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Indeed. This wine is perfect for me - Napa warmth, Bordeaux-ish structure, complex, terrific balance, ages brilliantly…AHHHH. Bill and Dawnine Dyer combine 80 years of experience in the wine industry here in the Valley, and own this sublime little spot on Diamond Mountain from which they make their magic (side note: I love that Bill’s first wine inspiration was a 1964 Ridge Zinfandel). The vineyard is located at an elevation of between 600 and 800 feet; it is extremely rocky with gray gravelly soils; the yields are fairly low. Despite such a small vineyard there are slight soil variations from one end to the other – with the lower reaches showing a slightly orange color to the soil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They make about 300 cases a year – and I drink about 3 of them! WONDERFUL WINE - what else can I say?! Except…don’t buy too much…the rest is mine!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: PAIRING IDEAS: The deceptively simple <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017319-simple-steak-au-poivre\">“Steak Au Poivre”</a> should elegantly pair here. I always up the amount of black pepper in this by 2x.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Start slow and finish with a bang, just like Fleetwood Mac and <em>“The Chain”</em>!",

Like so many of Christian’s Napa wines, this screams Bordeaux, Right Bank in this case, to our palates. From a cool part of the Oakville appellation (near Beckstoffer’s Missouri Hopper and Vine Hill Ranch), this is rich and creamy, but has an almost Pomerol-like sensibility to it – tightly wound, highly complex, with terrific balance and layered flavors that unfold over time. EPIC! And a perfect aging wine – this might outlive you...!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: We’d go with a simple seared, thick slice of sushi-grade tuna. A little salt and pepper is all you need, with a light salad to let the wine shine. THEN — a REALLY good cheese (Reblochon? Comte?), and crusty bread for after, as the wine opens and shines even more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: We just can’t get enough of this wine, so why not vibe to <em>“I Just Can’t Get Enough”</em> by Depeche Mode.",

    "description": "<p>Jean Gautreau worked as a negociant and later started his own firm in the late 1950s. Later he started a mobile bottling service in Bordeaux and eventually bought Sociando Mallet in 1969. Since then, the estate has had a complete makeover and expanded from the original 7 hectares to almost 85 today! It is a Bordeaux that is a favorite of sommeliers and wine pros worldwide. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beautifully mature Bordeaux from an icon of the Medoc, the warm and sunny vintage gave this often rustic estate, forward charm and a fruity quality that you do not always find in this wine. This is a super secret micro cuvee (frankly a wine that we had never heard of before) from Sociano-Mallet that was made in tiny quantities and never designed to leave the property. Just opened periodically for personal consumption and shown to his best friends and clients at the estate, we are stoked that we scored a super small parcel for you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sociando's signature backbone, minerality, tannin and acid spine have allowed this wine to hold up quite nicely over the years. This is a recent re-release from the Chateau, directly from their cold cellar just months ago, ready for immediate enjoyment!</p>",

    "description": "<p>2019, following the excellent 2018s, is THE mega-serious vintage to buy for the best Napa wines, and today we have a rockstar in the building. We've been following closely the progression of this special vineyard perched on the top of Pritchard Hill, and as the vines are now at prime age, Tim Mondavi is making the greatest of his life. On top of all that, this is a special collectors label from Continuum. As a family, they achieved 100 consecutive harvests and left a celebratory easter egg on the label. It's easier to find when the bottle is in your hands!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you see that score? Trust your wine merchant — it is ALL THAT. You need this in your cellar. Soaring with power and opulence, it’s like sliding into a Mercedes Maybach – so fine, silky and finessed, with so much dark fruit, tobacco, graphite (you might think you’re drinking 1st Growth Bordeaux, really) and lavish, mouthcoating texture...hints of mocha and exotic spice, but all in perfect balance. Just...WOW!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We wish we had more... This will go to the quickest fingers!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: This deserves something special – duck breasts? Leg of Lamb? The finest cut from <a href=\"https://www.flannerybeef.com/\">Flannery Meats</a>, grilled and topped with a bit of good truffle butter? YES!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: When we think of any Mondavi...we think, Elvis. Jam out to any one of the King of Rock and Roll’s albums, but on this rainy Monday morning, we’re especially feeling <em>“Suspicious Minds”</em>!",

Beautifully focused and detailed on the palate, it exudes notes of balsamic, licorice, and sweet pipe tobacco, before the voluminous mid-palate makes its way to a focused, clean, and long finish built on super-fine tannins. It’s pure Brunello class. So good and heart-warming and the ESSENCE of what we love about this business - sunshine, everything Italian, pasta, sangiovese...you know what we mean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Pasta, of course! We’d go with a simple (yet incredibly complex) cacio e pepe, a dish we can’t get enough of. Here’s a recipe – it’s mega-important to have plenty of pasta water handy to silken the sauce!</p>\r\n\r\n<P>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Sometimes, repetition is a good thing. Moody frontman enigma Morrissey does it better than most, especially in <em>“Everyday is Like Sunday”</em>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Did you know? The Usseglios are of Italian descent, having moved to the Chateauneuf region in 1931. With 18 hectares of vines, half near the ruins of the new castle of the Pope and half in La Crau, they are one of the most respected and coveted producers in the entire region.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now, to 2019. The best since 2016, it is going to be one of the finest EVER – aficionados and collectors should put this vintage at the very top of their lists. With perfect weather, no mildew or hail to speak of, and a warm and dry summer, the new Cuvée Impériale literally embodies everything we love about Chateauneuf - ripeness, purity, balance, and even a sense of elegance missing in some lesser vintages. BIODYNAMIC. Organic. 95% grenache, from 100+ year vines. So pure, refined, generous and complex...it's just...awesome!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you buy one classic CdP from us this year...BUY THIS!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: We’ll be spending all day Saturday brining St. Louis pork ribs, then seasoning, then drying, then grilling to a good char, THEN smoking for 2-3 hours (it’s a reverse style, going to try it out for you), then serving it with a Caesar salad with TONS of parmesan and grilled bread!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Listen to classic French songs while drinking this classic CdP! <em>\"La Vie en Rose\", \"La Mer\"</em>...whatever your jam is! </p>",

    "description": "<p>Les Pargues is a special site, nestled among the 1er Crus of Butteaux and Forêts (both actually part of the larger Montmains 1er cru), with a mirroring southeast exposure. Though the cool spring of 2019 escaped serious frost damage for the first time in a few years, the vintage was not without its challenges, as a warm summer and a brief bout with hail kept vintners on their toes. But in the end, this vintage turned out some truly mind-blowing wines. Romain Collet had this to say about the overall conditions of the vintage and Les Pargues, in particular:</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p><em>“The technical aspects of the fruit were relatively favorable… and we had no problem with the fermentations. As to the wines, I like the balance and the underlying tension… the 2019's are both richer but still with great acid levels. Our site \"Les Pargues\" fared especially well this vintage, and shows the typicité of the site. Taking everything into account, Alan and I agreed to hold on to the 2019 wines a bit longer to let them develop more in the bottle so that they will be the most delicious to drink when the wines arrive in America.\"</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Well, here they are! Without question worth the wait as this wine is a close-your-eyes-and-imagine-Chablis textbook example of the region. It’s flinty, lemony, flowery, chalky, piquant, green apples, weight without heaviness, zippity-do-dah freshness all the livelong day. You could teach Chablis school off of this wine… but you could just as easily hoard the bottle for yourself, grab a dozen oysters and have a clandestinely spectacular Friday afternoon (I’m leaning towards the latter).</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The Collets broke free of the negociant model in 1979 and have spent the last five decades building a reputation for consistent excellence across their portfolio. After his father suffered a stroke in 2008, Romain Collet took over winemaking at Domaine Collet, adding on his own eponymous domaine the following year (he was 23 years old). Today, the family controls an impressive suite of parcels in Chablis’ best sites: Les Clos, Valmur, Mont de Milieu, Montée de Tonnerre, Vaillons, Montmains, Butteaux, Séchet, Les Forêts, and of course, Les Pargues.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>With supplies tightening over the last handful of vintages, and demand soaring to all time highs, this lands squarely in the gotta-have category. If you haven’t tried Collet’s wines, or if you just love classic expressions of white Burgundy, these need to be at the top of your list!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Oysters always, of course, but another great option is this “Hot Smoked Trout with Fennel, Peas and Goat’s Cheese” salad from Ottolenghi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tMUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Bob Dylan’s <em>“Lay, Lady, Lay”</em> is a departure from his usual socially charged, poetic wordplay mastery. The story goes, he quit smoking cigarettes for a period and became enamored of how his voice suddenly purred out harmonies. He wrote and recorded the melodic ditty … loving the sound but eventually, hating the song, personally. Naturally, it went on to become one of his biggest hits.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Domaine Ponsot is one of the heavy hitters when it comes to the great estates of Burgundy…just ask infamous wine forgery expert, Rudy Kurniawan, who was famously outed by Laurent Ponsot for making vintages that could not have existed. Worry not, this parcel comes direct from the wineries importer with the most pristine provenance possible. How can that be possible at the best price in the US? Don't ask, just lock this in!</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Founded in 1872, the Ponsot family has been making stellar, age worthy Burgundies in each of the past four generations. Their approach is highly traditional – they never use any new oak for aging, they ferment in the classical, open-top, conical oak vats, and their processing, through to fermentation, racking, and aging is all achieved through the use of their gravity-flow facility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As is common in Burgundy (and most great wine regions), increasing the quality of the wine begins in the vineyards. Ponsot believes in applying sustainable, organic, and even biodynamic practices that have developed over the years, whenever possible, across all their holdings – yet refusing to rigidly adopt any series of practices for the mere sake of outside certification. This philosophy, known as \"la lutte raisonnée\" in French (which translates as \"measured control\") requires intense, on-going evaluation of every vines' health and progress throughout the year and consistent adaptation to the conditions of each vintage. For this bottling, the fruit hails from the parcel of Monts Luisants, perched just above the Grand Cru of Clos de la Roche. There, you’ll find 3 separate sub-sections of soils, layered in bands that slope down into the Grand Cru. At the top, the soil is the compacted Bathonian limestone of the Comblanchien, descending down into the white oolite of the middle section, and finally the Premeaux limestone of the lowest section of the vineyard. And yet, because of the very steep slope, Comblanchien debris is found on the oolite section and oolite rubblerock on the Premeaux section and so on, carrying down into the soils of Clos de la Roche and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The fruit is carefully hand-sorted in the vineyard, so that any bacterial-induced spoilage cannot be transferred to pristine clusters, as the grapes travel in small, wicker baskets to be processed. Domaine Ponsot focuses on phenolic ripeness rather than physiological ripeness for their picks, meaning that the grapes must taste, smell and feel as they should, instead of modern reliance on accepted sugar-levels, acidic balance, and color density determinations. In 2016, yields were microscopic, but quality was quite high, yielding a wine of concentration, ripeness, and intensity that boast of either a long-cellaring ability or early-drinking hedonism and intensity.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>This is a magnificent offering that squarely falls as an insider special. Burghounds know the producer very well, but the specifics of this bottling are not widely available and we had to hear the story direct ourselves. Needless to say, we were thrilled to get a few cases of this beauty, and at the price we have today…this is a wine worth collecting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: This one is for a special occasion… <a href=\"https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/squab-with-cherries-and-foie-gras-recipe-1957392\">Squab with Cherries and Foie Gras</a> will complement that nicely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Something kinda jazzy, kinda rocking, but kinda romantic too… Van Morrison, you’re up! <em>“Moondance”</em> should help set the mood for the perfect evening.</p>",

    "description": "<p>We’re opening a bottle as you read this. Matt is an organic and biodynamic winegrowing expert in addition to his winemaking chops, which you’ll appreciate the moment this hits your glass. Pinot people! Sonoma Coast at its finest -- tons of energy in this wine, hugely aromatic with purple fruit, plum jam, a bit of dark cocoa powder, sweet herb and tons of bright, focused flavors. Finishes up all yummy with a touch of clove-y spice and even a bit of orange citrus. The production of these is so small, it’s pretty amazing to have a few. Grab it while we have it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: A simple roast chicken is perfect! This is my go-to recipe from Samin Nosrat's cookbook <em>\"SALT FAT ACID HEAT\"</em>. Such an easy recipe! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: This gorgeous pinot spins me <em>\"right round, baby, right round\"</em>. Blast some of that good Dead or Alive song, and have an awesome Saturday!!</p>",

    "description": "<p>We discovered Hiller some years ago on a Germany trip, oddly enough, and THANK GOODNESS. What a score!! A family wine estate in Great Reipersdorf near Pulkau in Austria, these reds and whites are some of the sexiest wines for the money on planet earth. You can get a 6-pack with FREE GROUND SHIPPING for $143.70, insane for wine at this level! A First Bottle world exclusive...you can’t find this anywhere else, and if you did, it would run you closer to $40! Everyday-all-the-time drinking wine. Try some, bet you’ll be back! The perfect BBQ drinking, summer-lovin’ red to drink when the mercury is rising.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>For the first time since we started importing these wines years ago, we visited the property in Pulkau a couple months ago (a couple photos from our trip below), and we love this winery now more than ever (is that even possible?). We had Simone’s mothers Schnitzel and did a midnight tour at the winery (yes, seriously) and stayed up drinking Gruner and Zweigelt until the wee hours of the morning. We tried their whole lineup and each bottle tasted, and there is simply not a bad wine in the lineup.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The Zweigelt is always a pleasure and the Rubin (translated to “Ruby”, referring to the grapes virbrant red color) is a blend of the wineries top vineyards in the Pulkau. Morello cherries, sweet herbs, cassis, licorice and toasty oak with hints of vanilla, lots of spice and some raspberry cream. It’s fresh, ripe and utterly delicious. Good God where to stop?!! Austria is going to blow the top of our heads off with this stuff! Deep and dark but still lithe on the palate, it is just a thrill a minute wine and makes us nuts thinking abut the food pairing possibilities (pretty sure we're going to try making a Peking duck tonight).</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Fun Facts about Zweigelt:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Leading red grape in Austria</p>\r\n<p>- A crossing between Blaufrankish and St. Laurant by doctor Frtiz Zweigelt</p>\r\n<p>- Dark, purple colour, fruity, spicy aromas of cherry and berry fruit. Soft tannins, moderate to low acidity, bit of spice.</p>\r\n<p>- The name of the grape is pronounced “TSVYE-gelt”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Peking duck people! The cinnamon and clove flavors all match beautifully here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Just because it is playing in the background right now as I sip my morning glass of Zweigelt, and it seems to be working magic. Steve Miller’s <em>\"Joker\"</em> is the perfect vibe.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>“Premiere lures major trade customers from across the world to California, where they can taste, mingle, and buy one-off wines made specially for the occasion, much like a booze-soaked bake sale.”</em> - Robb Report</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Indeed! We do it every year! What’s PNV? Premiere Napa Valley wines are the most unique wines made in Napa Valley. The event is a centerpiece of the Napa Valley Vintners, where, for 3-4 days a year, trade members like us get to bid on TINY quantities of very special wines (literally the best in the cellar), crafted just for this event, and we are able to taste during this short period. Though reminiscent of how Hospices de Beaune wines are produced in Burgundy, the process is uniquely American. HERE’S a good video to further explain, if you like! But know this -- these will not be seen again, EVER!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Today, we have the distinct pleasure to unleash this outrageously good, virtual UNICORN of a wine upon savvy cabernet-hunters across the land today — wow! We bought this lot a couple years ago after tasting dozens upon dozens of these super-limited offerings from the truly special 2018 vintage, and we’ve been waiting impatiently for it to finally arrive. It was an embarrassment of riches tasting the top lots from a vintage like 2018, but Mondavi’s To Kalon, an extra special selection from Genevieve’s favorite block in the entire vineyard, the Monastery Block, was one of the best of the 200+ wines tasted. This is the same block that her and Thomas Rivers Brown now have to fight over since Schrader (now owned by Constellation) is now bottling their own version of the Monastery Block. This is bottled Napa Valley history right here!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>A wine of immense structure and stature, this is built like a skyscraper with glorious, pixelated tannin and super expressive aromatics. Cabernet sauvignon forms the backbone of the wine with classically refined tannins and aromas of cassis, blackberry, kirsch and black plum. Merlot adds elegance and plushness, and the hint of cabernet franc heightens the aromatic intensity and earthiness. Petit verdot contributes black pepper spiciness and deepens the deep color. To add complexity and notes of baking spices, this Monastery Block blend was aged for 24 months in new French oak and then an additional year in the bottle. Enjoy between 2025-2060, if you must open soon, give this is good 3-5 hour decant.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>A masterpiece of a wine that will be a star of any cellar and a wine that we suspect will age like the great Reserve wines made at Mondavi in the the 1970s, many of which are still youthful. Don't miss this special wine...!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Grab a heavily marbled prime cut ribeye and get the grill ripping hot. That is really all you need here - the classic cab and a slab is going to make you very happy.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Got to go with some Chicago blues to get you in the right headspace. Check out Harmonica Shah’s <em>\"Boom Boom\"</em> for a real nice vibe as you pop a bottle.</p>",

    "description": "<p>What a blockbuster buy. Wow! We like to think we’re extra-picky when it comes to Barossa wines (there’s a lot of mint-bombs out there), and Glaetzer’s high-end wines (he’s legendary for the collectible Amon-Ra, of course) hit ALL our buttons. This price is, honestly, just head-spinning, like the wine itself.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>This is a relatively rare and highly sought-after gem from the fabled Glaetzer family in the Barossa Valley. They can trace their roots to the early days of Australia’s wine industry, getting their start in the late 1800s. Like Australia herself, this gorgeous concoction is bold, majestic and not for the faint of heart. At the jaw-dropping price of $49.95, this is a must have for your collection.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Much like the 2018s here in Napa, the Barossa Valley produced truly epic wines across the vintage. A warm year with even ripeness, ensured that shiraz and cabernet sauvignon thrived to produce rich, complex wines. Aromas of crushed violets with black and blue berries abound, matched by flavors of black currant, rosemary and aromatic cedar. The wine is full, yet supple - a wine to be enjoyed now and for the years to come, but pretty much irresistible for its boundless energy right now – we still can’t believe the price!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: For such a gutsy, rich, exuberant wine, go with a big hedonistic burger. Step it up a bit and do a lamb burger, drizzled with a bit of tzatziki and crumbled feta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: The Seahorses' “Love Is The Law” is a great little indie hit from the 90s.</p>",

    "description": "<p>We love this wine. The producer, the story, the history, the flavors, the age-ability...just everything. If you’ve been paying attention, we like to represent. We’re always on the lookout for older vintages, large formats, anything we can get our wine-besotten mitts on, really (that bottle of 1974 is still one of the greatest bottles of California wine I’ve ever had…at a spry 46 years old, no less!). Our fiercest, most dyed-in-the-wool First Bottlers just can’t get enough. So here we are!</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 2018 is yet another great vintage for this groundbreaking hillside winery. With ample fruit flavors up front of cherry and raspberry, the wine is already showing well in its infancy. But as the wine opens and deepens in the glass, spice, herb, and earth notes take root, complementing the fruit and intensifying the complexity for the long haul. Iron ore, bay laurel, and Chinese five spice are all there, beckoning for the brilliant future.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> If you don’t already know School House, you’ll want to check this out…a true \"cult\" winery before \"cult\" was even a THING, like several decades before the “cult” thing. There is a LOT of VERY COOL Napa history here... The brand was re-established in the 50s and is one-of-a-kind, perched up high on Spring Mountain. So many layers to peel back on this producer… glorious factoids, below!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- DRC. Let’s start with the big daddy…The cuttings for the School House vineyard were brought by Inglenook’s founder, the legendary Gustave Niebaum. When they converted the vineyard to cabernet in the 50s, THOSE cuttings went to School House! To this day, it is the only clonal selection there.</p>\r\n<p>- School House was planted in 1953 after current owner John Gantner’s father purchased the property the decade prior for a jaw-dropping $25/acre.\r\nThe vineyard is dry-farmed and organic. Dry farming pinot on the hillsides of northern Napa just boggles the mind. Yields are beyond miniscule as a result, but they keep at it.</p>\r\n<p>- Incredibly hard to find; retailers get a few bottles here and there but most of it goes to restaurants and savvy collectors. Only 320 cases total pinot made in 2018!</p>\r\n<p>- For decades the minuscule production has been made at Pride Mountain Vineyards.</p>\r\n<p>- The price. We continue to be shocked to ever GET any, much less at a price like this.</p>\r\n<p>- Great notes on past vintages on CellarTracker and the like. Worth noting the fantastic aging potential, too -- many of the 70s wines are still rocking.</p>\r\n<p>- More info on the history <a href=\"https://wakawakawinereviews.com/2014/10/10/a-visit-to-school-house-vineyard-the-spring-mountain-district/\">HERE</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grab a handful, drink a couple and hide the rest. I’ll keep my forwarding address updated, so that 30 years from now when I am long since retired and reading a book by a fire somewhere, you can send me a note and talk about how stellar this wine still is!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Before winter sets in, my thoughts are already drifting to a weekend of BBQing....this <a href=\"https://girlscangrill.com/recipe/smoked-carolina-pulled-pork/\">Carolina-style pork shoulder</a> is definitely in the queue and perfect for this pinot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: It seems every time we get this we feel like celebrating… hop in to the Way, Way Back Machine with Irene Cara’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILWSp0m9G2U\"><em>“What a Feeling”</em></a>!",

A great bottle at any price…at $17.95, this is divine!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Damien Pinon is a new producer for us, but they’ve been making delicious chenin-based wines for three generations. Damien (with his wife Ingrid) is the third generation to head the family estate. Their homage to the long-standing family traditions while still looking to the future with modernized techniques is a common challenge that they have accomplished perfectly. Today, their primary objective lies in the careful expression of their unique terroir – principally the clay and limestone soils the area is famed for. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we tasted this, we knew we had to have it. Lots of it. We jokingly call it a “cellar defender” because it’s the perfect thing to open and share while your $100+ bottles rest until a special occasion… without sacrificing the opportunity to drink some killer bubbly. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>You’ll be impressed. Severely impressed. This Brut de Brut is packed with crisp white nectarine, quince, flinty stones, bartlett pear, and honeysuckle – ultra-crisp, rich, and flat-out delicious. Pretty easy to drink if we do say so!! While it lasts!</p>",

The crux of Almaviva’s success is the combination of their treasures: Chile offers its soil, its climate, and its vineyard, while France brings its winegrowing traditions and expertise. However, native Frenchman, Friou, who joined Almaviva in 2007 as chief winemaker, recognizes another essential piece to this puzzle: local knowledge. Having already worked in Chile for more than a decade, at Escudo Rojo and Casa Lapostolle, and Chateau Margaux (among others in France) before taking over at Almaviva, he’s had time to cultivate a local understanding.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>If you know, you KNOW – don’t miss this one, we barely got enough to send out an email!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Domaine Dubreuil-Fontaine has remained a fixture of the Côte de Beaune since the late 1800s. The estate possesses 20 hectares of prime vineyards within Corton as well as the nearby villages of Beaune, Volnay, Pommard and their home estate here, in the medieval town of Pernand-Vergelesses. “Clos Berthet” is the monopole where they make this wine, plus a 1er Cru chardonnay. Fifth-generation vintner, Christine Gruere-Dubreuil, calls this wine her “Mini-Corton” and we can’t disagree. From the delicate aromas of strawberries and bergamot tea, to the underriding current of earthy, mineral tones, and the culminating finish that is both fruit-forward and silky smooth – this wine has all the notes we so love about Red Burgundies, at a price that defies all logic and reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christine, a recent recipient of the prestigious \"Les Femmes aux Commandes\" award from one of France’s leading Burgundy publications, Bourgogne Aujourd'Hui, has transformed and modernized the estate since taking over from her father, Bernard. With a focus on initial sorting during harvest, to full-destemming and additional sorting in the winery, Christine has also transitioned to stainless steel fermentations and less-frequent punchdowns to achieve fiercely energetic and highly polished wines with alluring textures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best deals in Burgundy to be had anywhere, because that is what we here at First Bottle do!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: While Beef Bourguignon and Coq au Vin would absolutely work... well, that’s a little too “vanilla” for our tastes. Live a little and try this with some Panang Curry Beef from your favorite Thai restaurant, or just make it yourself, here.</p>\r\n\r\n<P>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: It’s Monday, which means you’re likely already planning on how to get out of work this Friday and enjoy a nice, long weekend. Take some inspiration from one of the funniest songs of all-time, <EM>“The Sick Note”</EM> by The Dubliners.</P>",

Christine has also transitioned to stainless steel fermentations and less-frequent punchdowns to achieve fiercely energetic and highly polished wines with alluring textures. In the warm, powerful vintage of 2018, Christine had this to say:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>\"It was a fairly quick harvest, eight or nine days, around normal. The growing season had been easy with fine weather, quite hot during summer but without hydric stress since there was quite a bit of water in the soil from the previous winter. There is good quantity…and there were quite high sugar levels, so that alcohol levels are…higher for the reds, between 13%, in some cases over 14% and a couple of reaching 15% that didn’t finish their sugars. We had to inoculate those again with yeast. That’s the first vintage that I have seen at those levels, though there seems good balance. It’s the vintage that everyone dreams of.\"</p></em>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Time for the bad news… We don’t have much. ONLY 10 CASES, in fact. Do what you must and make sure you get yours while you can!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Everybody keeps duck confit in their freezer at all times, right?

    "description": "<p>Welcome, for the first time in North America, Almaviva’s “Epu” red blend. When two of the greatest houses of their respective countries combine their centuries of experience, wisdom, and creativity to fashion a wine… you’d best take note. Such has been the case of Almaviva - a Franco-Chilean endeavor that has been sought with fervor by the most impassioned collectors for nearly two decades. The flagship wine has years of critical praise and has inspired a frenzy of Indiana Jones level treasure seekers, while still remaining relatively off-the-radar in the wine world at large (check our write-up on big brother, <a href=\"https://www.firstbottlewines.com/product/detail/AA15892\">here</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>We expect all that to change, in a big way, with the first international release of “Epu”. Technically, it’s a second label, but think more along the lines of Screaming Eagle’s “The Flight” or Scarecrow’s “M. Etain”... this is a serious wine, with spectacular pedigree and the full attention and artistry of the winemaking team. Weighing in at 84% cabernet sauvignon, 13% carmenere, 2% merlot and 1% cabernet franc, this wine is sure to inspire enthusiasts all its own. Less ripe than its sibling, this wine showcases the nuance and delicate notes of a fine Bordeaux. Blue fruits, fresh flowers, and a Mediterranean spice market highlight the aromas, with silky tannins and casual elegance building through to the wine’s glorious crescendo. A single year in once-used barrels keeps things both fresh and creamy, with the perfect drink-me-now or drink-me-later appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The vineyards are high elevation, with rocky and loamy soils providing additional stress to complement the region’s Mediterranean climate. Hot days and cool nights help preserve the grapes’ acidity throughout the growing season—allowing for both power and elegance to balance the resulting wine. Wow, deja vu! That is exactly what you’d say about Howell Mountain… or Pritchard Hill, Atlas Peak, Stagecoach or a handful of other spots found here in the best of Napa’s Hillside Vineyards. It couldn’t possibly be a coincidence!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Did we mention $55?!?! Early adopters, value collectors, and wine lovers in general… you need some of this wine! Hardly any to be had, so go, go, GO!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Ever heard the phrase <em>\"What grows together, goes together”</em>? These <a href=\"https://www.curiouscuisiniere.com/empanadas-de-pino/\">Empanadas de Pino</a> are point-in-fact proof of that. Ground beef, onions, olives, raisins and hard-boiled eggs make THE authentic Chilean snack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Almaviva is named for the Count and hero in Beaumarchais classic <em>“The Marriage of Figaro”</em>. Mozart made it into a comedic opera, but you’ve heard <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OZCyp-LcGw\">this tune</a> in countless modern films. <em>“Trading Places”</em> for me!",

    "description": "<p>Vinous’ Neal Martin has famously proclaimed that <em>\"South Africa is frankly unbeatable in terms of quality-to-price ratio.\"</em> And while we can think of a few other contenders for that crown, we don’t disagree with his sentiment. With a fantastic 97 POINTS from the prestigious Decanter World Wine Awards, this wine proves that the best of South Africa consistently provides immense quality far beyond what one expects. At nearly 40% OFF, this is a perfect opportunity to explore one of South Africa’s best!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Long-heralded as a top producer in Stellenbosch, Warwick’s flagship Cabernet-based Proprietary Red is an incredible wine–that just happens to be an incredible value. Oh man, just wait until you see this price…clocking in at 55% cabernet franc, 42% cabernet sauvignon, and 3% merlot, this wine packs in an absolute wallop of deep, intense flavors. Crushed blackberries, herb-crusted roast lamb, black tea, and spiced plum tarts offer up heady and intoxicating sensations which draw you in for a deep dive into the full-bodied and complex mouthfeel. The finish goes on and on and on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To craft this wine, each component is harvested, de-stemmed, and hand-sorted to vinify separately. Fermentation and maceration can last for up to 40 days, with 3 to 4 pump overs each day, before racking to barrels for 24 months of aging (55% new French oak). All in the name of depth and concentration, this wine is something to savor! With wonderful polish and complexity, this can stand toe to toe with the great wines of Bordeaux. At the price we got going today, expect it to fly quickly!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>** Called \"Trilogy\" in South Africa, and elsewhere, the name of the wine here in the U.S. is changed to \"Reserve\"...to avoid infringement with a certain Napa wine. **</p>",

The Daumens family has been farming the estate since the early 1900's. These highly sought-after wines are the stuff of legends, with countless 100 point scores and an almost ethereal cloak of greatness shouldered about them. The 2019 vintage for the region is both phenomenal and unique – a graceful elegance complementing the traditional power and depth of CDP’s best vintages. You just might have found a new “Pride of Place” for your collection!",

    "description": "<p>This wine, this estate, the history, the cast of characters - it’s all a bit too much! This is the sort of an A-LIST ensemble typically reserved for Hollywood’s big studio summer blockbusters. Originally planted in the 1860s by the Sullivan family (descendants of the de Latours of Bordeaux, founders of Beaulieu Vineyards), this western Rutherford Bench site was re-planted under the guidance of the legendary André Tchelistcheff in 1963 (with fruit consistently finding its way into BV’s top bottlings). The Staglin’s purchased the vineyards in 1985 and have added nearly 40 years of continued excellence to the portfolio.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The wine is fashioned with a nod to Burgundy... plus the unmistakable influences of California’s world famous sunshine. Whole cluster pressed and barrel-fermented, followed by 10 months aging sur lie with minimal batonnage (stirring on the lees,) this chardonnay is expressively layered with heady aromatics ranging from honeysuckle to star jasmine and complemented with ripe tropical fruits notes and spiced citrus flavors. Roughly 50% new barrels add a creamy, caramel corn richness yet the bracing acidity counter-balances to brighten and intensify the long and tempting finish. At nearly 50% off, this is a Rickey Henderson worthy steal!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: The perfect dish for summer is deceptively easy to make: <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1155016/succotash-seared-scallops\">Seared Scallops with Succotash</a>! Head to your local farmer’s market to load up on these veggies, find some plump Dayboat Scallops (never frozen) from your favorite fishmonger, and pull out grandma’s cast iron skillet.\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: This superstar ensemble needs a supergroup to make it shine. Arguably the first, certainly the greatest, The Traveling Wilburys’ <em>“Handle with Care”</em> hits with all the feels.",

    "description": "<p>90+ year old vines from a trusted Vigneron family just around the bend from Meursault-Charmes. This wolf and sheep's clothing is bound to be your next Burgundy epiphany!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lieu-dit, Murgey de Limozin, maintains chardonnay plantings going back to 1924 on the outskirts of the village of Meursault. Pierre Boisson deftly crafts this Bourgogne Blanc in a classic style with minimal amount of new oak (~20%) and plenty of fleshy, full fruit. Last time we had some of the Boisson clan's wines up on First Bottle we were blown away by the response and have been trying hard since to secure another parcel. Today is the day!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The old vines are meticulously farmed, with minimal intervention in the winery. Unlike many in the region, there is no stirring of the lees (battonage) resulting in pristine clarity and velvety textures. Following native yeast fermentation and a prolonged elevage of 18-22 months, the wine is lightly fined and bottled unfiltered. A thrilling combination of pristine verve and perfectly judged creaminess. With over two centuries of the family crafting wines in Burgundy, the current generation of Pierre and his sister, Anne, have embraced the “classic style” while still pushing each new vintage to greater heights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Oysters and Bourgogne Blanc are just too perfect a pairing to ignore! But step your game up a notch with a dollop of this <a href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/cucumber-granita\">matcha cucumber granita</a> from Chef James Shyahabout of Hawker Fare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Take a sip of the wine and a bite of the above and press play on Radiohead’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M_Gg1xAHE4\"><em>“Pyramid Song”</em></a>. Close eyes, extend arms, and spin slowly while swaying slightly. Repeat.",

    "description": "<p>Like delicate, ethereal wines? Well, step aside. This wine is for the bold, the daring, the fiercely demanding lovers of intense fruit and spice, leather and tobacco, roasted Herbs de Provence, and the occasional, late-night sip of Fernet Branca.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Xavier Vignon has achieved what is oh-so-difficult in the wine world–embracing tradition while simultaneously pushing modernity to the forefront. The flavors of dark bramble berries and cherries explode out of the gate, with wafting aromas of oil-rubbed leather and softly smoldering sprigs of lavender, sage and thyme lingering behind. The finish is dry, intensely spiced and first-tracks-on-a-powder-day smooth. A veritable heavy weight’s punch with the footwork of a fly weight.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Xavier selects fruit from 12 separate plots in Lirac on alluvial clay soils covered with the region’s famous “galets roulés” stones just like neighboring Chateauneuf du Pape. He then co-ferments the grenache and syrah to enhance the wine’s aromatic complexity prior to aging for 12 months, 70% in concrete tanks and 30% in barrel. This is the perfect wine to have in magnum… saves you the step of immediately opening another bottle after sharing with a couple friends! The perfect grilling companion for all things bold, plus there's no better way to roll into a party than with a magnum of full-throttle red!</p>\r\n\r\n<P>PAIRING IDEAS: Following Xavier’s own recommendation, this complexly spiced <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a26815749/moroccan-lamb-tagine-recipe/\">Moroccan Lamb Tagine</a> will take the wine to even greater heights. And, just like a magnum, this dish is perfect to share!</P>\r\n\r\n<P>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: There’s just something about magnums and classical music. The orchestral composition of Sergei Rachmaninoff’s <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koqOEd10GdI\">\"Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini\"</a></EM> is the perfect fit here.</P>",

    "description": "<p>Right, so did you get some? We sure hope so, ‘cause this is likely all we’ll get of this beautiful creature. By now, you probably know snippets of the Lail story. Founder Robin Lail had a great-granduncle who answered to the name Gustave Niebaum. Yes, the Gustave Niebaum, founder of Inglenook. The man created what was arguably Napa’s first great wine house, before decades of drama and bad timing led to the brand’s very public downfall and deterioration into the realm of cheap jug wines (for all the sordid details, read James Conaway’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Napa-Story-American-James-Conaway/dp/0618257985\">\"Napa: The Story of an American Eden\")</a>. Robin Lail’s epic transformation from a young woman dispossessed to a veritable tour-de-force shaping the modern age of Napa Valley is a tale worthy of the big screen and a hero’s journey worthy of Joseph Conrad.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>This release serves as the 25th anniversary of the cuvee, with Antonio Galloni going so far as to say 2019 is one of the best editions…ever. Given the number of 100 point scores this cuvee has received from critics over the years… my, my, my… that is saying something, indeed. This 100% cabernet sauvignon marries fruit from four distinct and obsessively treasured Napa Vineyards - Vine Hill Ranch in prestigious Oakville, Heimark in the eastern hillsides of Calistoga, Steltzner under the palisades of Stag’s Leap and the Lail’s own estate of Mole Hill high up on Howell Mountain. The 2019 vintage is quickly shaping up to be one of the very best Napa has ever seen, and if you’re looking for the best of the best… this might well be a contender.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>This is Holy Grail status napa cab, to be sure. If you’re looking to impress your friends or shame your nemesis, this is the wine to do it!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Winemakers are constantly experimenting and honing their craft to push the limits of wine to ever greater heights. Many experiments are destined to swirl down the drain, or are blended out as a small portions of larger projects to mask their impact. When owner/winemaker John Benedetti set out to make a single vineyard pinot noir from the La Estancia vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands, both of those outcomes were certainly on the table. After one sip, we’re confident you’ll see, as we did, that avoiding those outcomes was the only possible choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wine is delicately colored, with pomegranate and sage aromas emanating from the glass. The flavors are bright and tart, notes of cranberry, Rainier cherries, lavender, and hibiscus agua fresca, with a hint of spicy clove and sweet vanilla.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>La Estancia vineyard sits in the heart of the Santa Lucia Highlands appellation, on the east-facing slopes of the Santa Lucia range above the town of Gonzalez. River loam soils and large temperature shifts lend intensity to the wines grown there. The vineyard is planted to a mixture of Dijon clones 777, 667, 115 with some Swan and Pommard, as well. 90% of the fruit is destemmed before a 3-day cold soak leading into a native yeast fermentation finished by selected Burgundy yeasts. The wine received twice daily punch downs during primary fermentation with secondary completed in barrel. The wine spent 10 months in French oak, 10% new. Only 16 barrels (~400 cases) produced.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>To recap: Micro-production, single-vineyard, ethereal pinot noir from Santa Lucia Highlands for $20... So, yes, you need some of this!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Pinot and salmon is a perennial favorite for me. This <a href=\"https://themodernproper.com/honey-mustard-salmon-with-summer-vegetable-salad\">Honey Mustard Salmon with Summer Vegetable Salad</a> is a perfect complement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Oren Lavie’s smooth voice and harmonic upbeat-melancholy made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_HXUhShhmY\"><em>“Her Morning Elegance”</em></a> a hit. The video plays like an art student’s dreamscape in stop-motion.</p>",

For a wine with minimal oak use, it surprises with a layered complexity not typically seen at this price point.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGrapes are sourced from high-altitude sites in the Uco Valley and Luján de Cuyo, at elevations between 2,306 and 3,927 feet. The hand-harvested grapes are fermented with selected and native yeasts in 8- and 17- ton closed-top stainless steel tanks. The wine is matured in 10% new oak barrels for eight months prior to bottling unfined and unfiltered. Don't miss!\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: If you’ve ever been to Napa, you likely drove by a fully-packed spot called Mustards Grill. They are famous for their Mongolian Pork Chops and this wine will make them sing!</p\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: The Rolling Stones have too many hits to name, but one of my favorites rarely gets the attention it deserves. Doing my part to change that, here! Enjoy <em>“Stealing My Heart”</em>!</p>",

    "description": "<p>This, the flagship gruner veltliner in the Hiller portfolio, rocks (quite literally, actually!). Not only are the grapes grown in the cool, rocky, granitic, primeval soils of lower Austria’s Weinviertel region, the finished wine is actually matured in one-of-a-kind barrel made from granite (yes, made from granite, see photo below) for 12 months! Only a single barrel is produced every year!! Hate to be the cellar intern tasked with rolling those around. Hannes told us about the struggle of getting this into the winery - it was so heavy, it tipped the forklift over! The walls of the barrel are 6 inches thick and it ways several tons!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\"Steinzeit\" translates to <em>“stone age”</em> – perfectly encapsulating the grapes’ beginnings, the wine’s creation, and the flavor profile all in one word! This is an extremely complex wine with enormous crushed granite minerality (duh!), crisp stone fruits, bright lemons, fragrant honeydew melon and an undercurrent of spine-tingling acidity extending the finish. A wine this dense needs time to stretch its legs, so decant an hour if drinking soon, and feel free to sit on a couple bottles of this for a decade plus! We rarely say such things about gruner veltliner, but that tells you just how intricately constructed and deeply layered this wine is. We tasted a vertical of this wine going back to the first vintage on our recent visit to the winery this spring and were blown away by the ageability, and outright complexity in this cuvee. The custom label, is made with real granite to boot, so if you are not a fan of stony minerality in your wines, this wine is not for you.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The vineyards are rooted in the foothills of the Manhartsberg, where two climates collide on two distinct ancient soil types that go back 555 million years. At this site the warmer, drier climate of the Weinviertel meets the harsh cooler climate of the Waldviertel – resulting in warmer, sunny days and bitingly cool nights throughout the growing season, all taking place on soils that combine volcanic granite, quartzite and marble with eroded sandstone and loam. All in all, one of the most unique sites in Austria for growing grapes, all leading to one of the most intriguing and complex gruners we’ve ever tasted! Just over 20 cases available, so speak up and get a move on!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: This wine has us begging… begging for Thai food. The perfect match? These Green Curry Mussels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: It had to be done… The only Billboard number one in U.S. history in German. Austria’s own Falco singing <em>“Rock Me, Amadeus”</em>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>$13 for a premium, California rosé, crafted from their estate pinot noir in cool-climate Anderson Valley, guided by pinot-savant Stéphane Vivier is just a monumental deal. At 50% off the winery retail, you’ll have enough left over to add-on Long Meadow Ranch’s famous cheddar biscuits with shaved ham and red pepper jelly at their St. Helena institution Farmstead (seriously, add this to your list of must-try snacks on your next visit to Napa!).</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Stéphane Vivier is a native Burgundian who received his enology and viticulture degrees from the Université de Bourgogne in Dijon. After honing his skills working harvests in Pommard, Meursault, and Chassagne-Montrachet, he switched focus to New World wine regions, with stints in New Zealand and the Russian River before being tapped to head up winemaking at Hyde de Villaine, a California-Burgundy partnership between local grower Larry Hyde and Domaine de la Romanee-Conti’s Aubert de Villaine. Quite the resume, indeed!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The LMR Anderson Valley estate has nearly 70 acres planted to pinot noir, chardonnay, and pinot gris. Between the nearby Pacific Ocean and the Navarro River to the southwest, there is a natural marine layer that blankets the vineyards and creates terroir ideal for the grapes to slowly mature and express their peak varietal characteristics. The vineyard soils are Pinole and Perrygulch loam dominant with slopes that vary between 2-35%. Pinole loam is very fine, with a lot of well-draining sand and clay. This block is planted to Calera, 777 and 828 clones, favored for their intensity and depth. Meanwhile, the Perrygulch loam possesses a higher volume of clay with the lowest pH and is planted to 115, 667 and 777 clones. “Big vines” tend to struggle here but the vigor is higher which tends to produce a higher concentration of flavors in the finished wines. For the rosé, grapes are selected early for harvest (to maintain a high acidity and freshness) and crushed separately in the traditional provencal style. The resulting wine is a delicately hued light pink, with notes of white strawberries, lemon, and pomelo fruits and a tarragon and saline edge to the finish. Crisp, dry and perfect for summer!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: If you can’t make it to Napa, let Napa come to you! Here’s the recipe for <a href=\"https://authenticsuburbangourmet.blogspot.com/2013/03/cheddar-cheese-biscuits-farmstead.html\">Farmstead’s cheddar biscuits</a>...just slice in half, slather with some red pepper jelly and thin slices of serrano ham to make a home version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>: MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: The Kinks dance the line between bubble-gum pop and irreverent musical geniuses as well as anybody in the history of rock ‘n roll. <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIKsHh3BFPI&t=11s\">“Sunny Afternoon”</a></em> should vibe perfectly with this rosé!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Manzone! One of our favorite producers anywhere, and we’ll be visiting them soon to taste through some new releases. These are some of the OGs of Montforte d’Alba, and they’ve thoughtfully acquired some amazing vineyard parcels over the years. This is 100% nebbiolo, from the lower parcel of the family’s famous Gramolere cru, in the heart of Montforte d’Alba. The only thing that stops this from being labeled as Barolo is the shorter aging time – making this a fresh, bright, and delicious “baby Barolo” at an unreal price!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don’t overthink this one…if you have had any of our Manzone Barolos – their crus, their riservas…you know this is a family that makes some seriously spectacular wines from the Nebbiolo grape. This is wildly delicious and complex – all without requiring cellaring, decanting, or that most precious of all things…time! 93 POINTS… just epic! A beautiful bouquet of alpine strawberries, lavender, and Luxardo cherries just leaps from the glass, turning to savory truffles, rose hips, red cherries, and more strawberries on the palate. The finish is focused and clean, with bright acidity priming you for another sip…and another…and… it’s gone! This will absolutely destroy many a lesser house’s Barolo (and at a fraction of the cost!). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fruit is all hand harvested from a lower parcel of their Gramolere holdings, where soils of calcareous clay marl slopes down to mix with finer sandy soils. Beneath the topsoil, there is a foundation of limestone, and “Il Crutin” refers to the historical stone cellar that was hand carved into the bedrock and used for wine and food storage nearby. The wine ferments in stainless steel tanks and then ages in neutral barrels for six months, followed by an additional six months in stainless steel prior to bottling. This is expressive, unadulterated Nebbiolo, with freshness and vivacity that is just flat-out delicious! This will fly… employee orders were coming in like an Oprah talk show… you get a case! You get a case! You…get the idea. While it lasts!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: This is my go-to for my all-time favorite pizza – Diavola’s “Sonja”. This is my favorite wine country restaurant, where Chef/Owner Dino named this wood-fired pie after his wife. Prosciutto, arugula, light sauce, and a bit of mascarpone… so good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: This is one of those songs that you never seek out, can never remember the artist, or the song title, and yet…whenever it comes on, you stop what you’re doing, get your jam on and sing along. Check out ‘Til Tuesday and <em>“Voices Carry”</em>!</p>",

    "description": "<p>PRICE DROP - $19.95 on 6 or more!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Domaine de la Madone is located on the slopes of the Madone hill overlooking the village of FLEURIE, one of the ten recognized Beaujolais crus in the northern half of the region. The vineyard Le Perréon sits atop crumbled pink granite soils at the top of the hill and is often considered by connoisseurs to be among the best of all Beaujolais-Villages sites. It enjoys exceptional sunshine throughout the growing season and has thrived under the stewardship of the Despres family for the last six generations. La Madone is the name of the small chapel erected at the top of the hill, topped with a statue of the Virgin Mary. It was raised in 1866 by local grape growers to protect the vines against powdery mildew. Arnaud Despres' great-great-grandfather was among those who hoisted the statue to the top with the help of their oxen. Over the years, a local push is ongoing to elevate the vineyard to cru status. Noted wine critic, William Kelley, had this to say about this exclusive site:</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p><em>“As I've written before, the steep slopes and decomposed pink granite of Le Perréon mean that its vineyards number among the finest in the Beaujolais-Villages appellation, and their potential for high quality is exemplified by Domaine de la Madone. Invariably beautifully balanced, supple and charming, these wines are delicious on release but also reliably age with grace. The 2020 vintage represents another fine success, and everything reviewed here comes warmly recommended.”</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vineyards are organically farmed, despite the numerous difficulties presented by the extremely steep slope and precariously loose top soil. The vines themselves are a minimum of 40 years old, with many 75+ years in age. Vinification is very traditional, hand-harvested by a crew of thirty pickers, and fermented via native yeasts in open top tanks before aging in a combination of tank and concrete vats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wine itself is classic Beaujolais with bright aromas of red cherries and raspberries, delicate floral notes of lilac and iceberg roses and a juicy core of black plums. In the mouth, the wine is rich yet agile, with velvety tannins and vibrant acidity. Good to go, but if you decide to grab a few and drink them over the next 5-7 years... We promise you won’t be disappointed!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Deceptively easy to make and rock-you-to-your-core delish, this chicken liver mousse is the ideal match for this wine. Serve with toast points, pickled shallots, and cornichons and you’ll be in culinary heaven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: If serious Beaujolais like this had a specific music genre, I’d argue it was early 80s punk rock. Case in point, The Descendents and <em>“Hope”</em>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Winemaker and co-owner Anne Vawter founded Red Mare Wines with Jim Striegel in 2007. She began her career at UC Davis, receiving a degree in Viticulture and Enology before taking on apprenticeships under Heidi Barrett at Paradigm Winery and Richard Sowalsky at Robert Mondavi. She went on to make wine for Oakville Ranch, Varozza, Ziata, Hoopes and Teaderman. An impressive C.V. indeed!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The 2017 aromas are reflective of the warmer vintage, with spicy honeysuckle and jasmine floral notes, complemented with beeswax, ripe nectarines and a kiss of freshly-mown grass. Once tasted, these characters are accentuated with cantaloupe, Tahitian vanilla and warm, toasty, peach cobbler. The mid-palate is decidedly fleshy and round, with a bright tension and acidity elegantly framed by aromas of toasty oak. THIS just tastes expensive and luxurious...no one has to know you paid less than the rest of the world! </p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Sourced from the heart of the Coombsiville AVA, Hestia Vineyard is named for the Greek goddess of the sacrificial fire. The vineyard sits on a gentle south-facing slope and is planted to both St. Peter’s Church and Musqué clones of sauvignon blanc. The vines, located in the lowest part of the swale, hold fog in the morning from the San Pablo Bay and are protected by a copse of trees on one side and wild chaparral on the other. The grapes grow in gravelly, fast-draining soils, much like the fields of Bordeaux blanc that the wine pays homage to. A bit of stone-laden Graves meets California sunshine and modern winemaking. The low-yielding crop is harvested at night before undergoing gentle pressing, with the juice transferred into a combination of new and used French oak barrels for fermentation and aged sur-lie for 22 months. With a total production of 152 cases, we got all that we could. For drinking now and savoring later, this white wine is a conversation in a bottle, and sure to delight and please over hours in the glass and with years to spare!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: With Oktoberfest approaching, fine tune your schnitzel game with this <a href=\"https://thefeedfeed.com/todayshomekitchen/mustard-pork-schnitzel-with-peach-mostarda-and-cucumber-relish\">Pork Schnitzel with Peach Mostarda and Cucumber Relish</a> – the textures, acids and bright fruit flavors should make for a perfect pairing.\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Psychedelic Alt Rock mainstay Spoon has quietly put together 30 years of music. <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8nF8L5Fgzc\">“Small Stakes”</a></em> sets the tone here.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Sylvain Gauthier was born and raised in the Northern Rhone but traveled to Beaune in the heart of Burgundy to study winemaking. Following his studies, he secured a job with the incomparable Michel Chapoutier and then with Stephane Robert of Domaine du Tunnel (another of the region’s rising stars) before settling in the village of Cheminas, founding Domaine Pierres Seches in 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>This new cuvée holds a special place in the mind of Sylvain. At this high altitude, purely granite, south-facing site, he went on to craft his first ever Saint-Joseph syrah. This site allows Sylvain to make a Saint-Joseph wine of remarkable power and elegant balance – loaded with black fruit and myriad spice – and possessing the boundless energy of classic Northern Rhone syrah. The 50+-year-old vines provide ample concentration and finely-grained tannins to ensure that this is a syrah with plenty of structure to thrive over a long cellaring.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>His micro-domaine is comprised of 13.5 acres of land, farmed organically, with the vineyards plowed by horse (or when the terrain becomes too steep – by hand). His holdings are all located in the southernmost portion of the Saint-Joseph appellation.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Vineyard holdings include small, steeply graded plots in the communes Sarras, Arras-sur-Rhône, Vion, Ozon, and crucially, in the renowned, southeast-facing lieu-dit of ‘Aubert’ on the Sainte Épine mountain in Saint-Jean de Muzols. The original boundaries, and villages of the Saint-Joseph appellation (drawn in 1956) are located here in the south. For the most part, Sylvain’s syrah is partially destemmed, but this special bottling is fermented whole-cluster. Fermentation occurs in temperature-controlled, stainless steel tanks on indigenous yeasts. His wines are aged in older French oak barrels, from 3-4 years old.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>This full-bodied, luscious syrah shows powerful black fruits like blackberries, black currants, and black plums, with a decided peppery, spicy edge that also includes warm notes of clove and anise seed. The grip is present yet refined, with the soft and velvety tannins uplifted by a steady, electric acidity. This beauty will seamlessly develop over the next two decades, though a brief decant of 30 minutes grants one access to this wonder in its youth. We were only able to get 20 cases total, and with this wine’s booming cult status, it will likely fly fast! Get some while it lasts!</p>",

    "description": "<p>96 points...for Beaujolais. Seriously, that never happens...and yet, this is just the latest in a long string of fantastic reviews for this producer. Without a doubt, under the guidance of Comtesse Alexandra de Vazeilles, Château des Bachelards has become the unquestioned finest producer in the region. Every. Single. Wine... They’re just that good.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Created by the Benedictine monks of Cluny around the year 1100, Château des Bachelards’ vineyards have been long revered by locals, sommeliers, and wine critics alike. Run by the Platet family for over 200 years, from 1793-2007, the estate is now managed by Alexandra de Vazeilles. Alexandra, the Comtesse de Vazeilles, who trained at Chateau Latour before taking on the domaine, has even surpassed the rigorous farming traditions upheld by both the Benedictine monks and the Platets, implementing organic and biodynamic techniques on top of next level additions like agroforestry in the vines, a permaculture vegetable garden, sheep for weed control and fertilization, naturally occurring bees, herbal medicine, horse-drawn soil cultivation, and more. This estate is widely considered to be making the best wines in its long and illustrious history, and let me tell you, as a team with decades of experience in food and wine, this wine is a revelation.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Moulin-à-Vent is known for a more powerful and structured Beaujolais, and this wine certainly marches that line. Brooding, intense aromas of black pepper, wild sage, and black currant, accompanied with more black fruits on the palate, with a savory, almost syrah-like meaty smokiness note... this may just be the most powerful Beaujolais you’ve ever tasted. No carbonic maceration; this is Burgundian elegance with a Northern Rhone iron fist.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The terroir of this Moulin-à-Vent bottling is a blend of several plots, with 80-100-year-old vines located on fine-grained, schist, and black granite rock. Along with clay particles imparting strength and power, the wine is balanced and honed by the limestone veins that bring freshness and tension. 24 months in barrel before bottling and a wine that is fresh and lively in the here and now, but with two decades of cellaring potential. What a treat! Grab some before it's gone!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Trust me on this...Chinese stir-fry is the perfect match here. Specifically, this Chicken with Black Bean Sauce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: This wine is all about harmony and power...so naturally, I’m going Florence + The Machine here with <em>“No Light, No Light”</em>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>From a tiny 1-acre plot of grenache on Mount Veeder at a stunning 2,500 feet - well above the fog layer - comes this picturesque vineyard with amazing valley views. We LOVE this mountain fruit, with its favorable diurnal shift of daytime highs to nighttime lows, making for optimal ripening conditions. Winemaker David Yorgensen is at the helm here, practicing minimal intervention techniques to allow the grape’s true nature to shine through – <em>“when one lets wine be itself, lets its character develop from within, rather than with an overabundance of external tampering, great wine happens!”</em></p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>David’s consulting projects and his own label \"Kind Cellars\" have racked up multiple 99-point ratings from Wine Advocate, and he brings that same skill and passion to Lampyridae Vineyards. One sip of this grenache, and we knew we had to have it! This wine walks the line between bright and baked red fruits, intermingled with lovely warm, baking spices, toasty oak and undertones of peppercorn and bay. Bright acidity, long finish and smooth tannins, this is a food-friendly wine begging for a spot on your dinner table.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>We just can’t get enough of this grenache... Trust us, this is a gem! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Grenache is a very under-utilized wine when it comes to food pairing. Let’s work to change that with this Sichuan classic: <a href=\"http://traditionalchineserecipes.blogspot.com/2011/06/chen-pi-niu-rou-tangerine-flavored-beef.html\">Chen Pi Niu Rou (Tangerine Flavored Beef)</a>. Go easy on the chilies!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: No voice oozes cool in quite the way that Nick Cave’s deep rough tones convey… Case in point, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds’ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrxePKps87k\"><em>“Red Right Hand”</em></a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Lavinea winemaker Isabelle Meunier cut her teeth in Burgundy (Domaine de la Vougeraie) and New Zealand (Felton Road), before falling on the radar of Dominique Lafon (of Domaine des Comtes Lafon). It was Dominique who put Isabelle forth as the winemaker for his first U.S. project, making her the winemaker at Evening Land back in 2007. In a short seven years, Evening Land had become the darling of Oregon’s avant garde wine scene, a prime opportunity for Isabelle to team up with Evening Land's CEO and president, Greg Ralston, on a new Oregon venture, Lavinea, opening in 2014. Almost immediately, Vinous’ Josh Raynolds proclaimed <em>“…I’m betting that LAVINEA will, in short order, be widely considered among Oregon’s elite producers.”</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With efforts like this 2017 chardonnay, we must concede the point. This is a full weight, decidedly fresh and lively chardonnay layered with confounding depth and texture. The nose is loaded with exotic spices, orange blossom, and ripe white peach aromas. The palate showcases more of the same with juicy Bartlett pear and smoky gun flint and black peppercorn. The finish is creamy and steely, with bright, persistent acidity that readies you for sip after delectable sip. Just over ten cases available, so make sure to get yours!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lazy River vineyard sits on a steep, south-facing slope of Mt. Richmond in the Yamhill-Carlton AVA. Set amongst a diverse terrain of woods, rolling meadows and ponds, the vineyards possesses a unique soil not common elsewhere in the region, though frequent in other grape growing areas of Oregon. “Jory” is a soil series consisting of very deep, well-draining red, loamy clay formed in a colluvium of basalt with a base of igneous volcanic rock. Such sparse soils encourage meager yields and intense concentration of fruit – ideal for high quality chardonnay and pinot noir. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This wine is made from densely planted twenty-year-old chardonnay vines, located at over 350 feet in the foothills of Oregon’s Coastal Range. The clonal material is all Burgundy-based, with clones 76, 95, and 548 all planted to 3309 rootstock (a V. riparia and V. rupestris crossing that has flourished in France following the Great French Wine Blight in the mid 1800s). Following a gentle, Champagne-style pressing of the grapes, the juice is settled for 12 hours before racking. From there, spontaneous, native yeast fermentation occurs entirely in barrel, with 15% new French oak. 100% secondary fermentation occurred over the next 11 months, just before bottling. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a scant 265 cases total produced, and given the “rising star” status of this producer, we had to fight just to get what we did. At the best price in the nation on this beauty, add some to your collection and enjoy over the next 7 years!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Much of the country has beautiful late summer mushrooms flushing right now. If your local grocer has chanterelles, grab some of those and work them in Jacques Pepin’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLUsCM5nq9I\">Scallops Grenobloise</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Now that you have a glass in hand and some lovely scallops ready to go, it’s time to set the mood. My vote...Mumford & Sons’ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EALWGx4cnUw\"><em>“Holland Road”</em></a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This wine has the sort of beautiful purity of color and depth of concentration that Northern Rhône does better than anywhere else. At first shy, the aromas whisper of warm, spice box and flinty mineral notes. As the wine opens, inky black fruits of plums and blackberry appear, with complements of licorice, kirsh, crushed violets, graphite, and roasted sage. On the palate, palatial depth is achieved with considerable intensity, length and breadth across the entire mouth – intensely berry driven without jamminess, with a soft and supple smokiness that is classic syrah. An hour in the decanter is ideal, with cellaring potential up to a decade.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Clearly, the family loves their history and folklore... “Ogier the Dane” was a fearsome giant of a soldier in Charlemagne’s army, who solidified his reputation in Charlemagne's campaigns in the Basque country before settling nearby in southeastern France’s Massif Central region. His descendant, Antoine Ogier, established himself in the wine business back in 1859, and generations of Ogiers have increased the holdings and the quality throughout the Rhône ever since. The Baligant vineyard is located in the Northern Rhône Valley on the right bank of the Rhône river, between flowery Condrieu in the north and rustic Cornas in the south. A vineyard comprised of granitic terraces and loose schist, “Baligant” is named for the Babylonian admiral and chief antagonist of Emperor Charlemagne in the battle for Zaragoza – a cunning and skillful enemy who earned great respect from Charlemagne, eventually falling to him in hand-to-hand combat – according to France’s oldest epic poem, the 11th century <em>\"The Song of Rolland\"</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The growing season is primarily influenced by the local Mediterranean climate and the enigmatic Mistral winds. After hand harvesting, Ogier’s oenologist (and technical director of Clos de l'Oratoire des Papes) Edouard Guérin justified his choice to remove all stems, stating that, <em>“Full de-stemming owing to the minerality of the soils. What we are seeking here is the purest expression of a Syrah planted in granite soils with notes of flint and ink, a certain austerity that is characteristic of wines from Saint-Joseph.”</em></p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>As fermentation progresses, the production team gradually increases the temperature of the tanks – both assuring that fermentation goes completely dry before pressing, while also encouraging a greater extraction of color and concentration from the must. Additionally, there is an extended maceration of 20-35 days in warm tanks (82 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit) before separation from the skins. Following pressing, 60% of the wine is matured in concrete, 20% each in large wooden vats and barrels that range from brand new to less than 2 years old. The wine ages for 12-24 months, depending on the vintage, before bottling.</P>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<P>We’ll say it again, not much to be had on this one. It deserves a spot in the collection of any aspiring Rhône Ranger, or simply any and all who love rich, concentrated, and complexly structured wines. For under $30, this wine packs a serious punch, guaranteed to impress and delight all manners of wine lovers. Grab some before it is gone forever!</P>",

    "description": "<p>In addition to being among the most historical and consistent producers in Chateauneuf du Pape, Clos de l’Oratoire is literally a pilgrimage site to Saint Marc, considered locally to be the patron saint of winemakers and the protector of the vines. With great scores (WE95, WA92, JS93,) this is the kind of pilgrimage we can get on board with!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Dating back to the year 1880, when Edouard Amouroux was endowed with a beautiful parcel of vines through marriage, the Clos de l’Oratoire has become a CdP icon. It was named after the oratory located just beneath the vines, dedicated to Saint-Marc, and still standing today. Decades after, in 1926, with the creation of their iconic, art deco-inspired bottle label that remains today – Clos de l’Oratoire became a permanent fixture in CdP folklore.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This classic producer created some of their all-time best wines in the near-perfect 2016 vintage that many experts are staking as one of the greatest CdP vintages in recent memory. For reference, here’s what spectacular Rhone super-consultant, Philippe Cambie, had to say:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“2016 has tannin, fruit, freshness, and power. It’s the best vintage of my life.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This composition of 80% grenache, 10% syrah, 5% cinsault, and 5% mourvèdre is a remarkably pure, concentrated, and agile wine. With aromas ranging from purple flowers to red berries, to smoky graphite and clove, the complexity starts right out the gate, further intensifying on the palate with deep blackberry and cherry notes, culminating in savory spicy notes of white pepper, anise, and bay laurel. The rigid structure and balanced acidity ensure this half bottle will easily drink well for another decade, at least.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What truly makes this estate so unique is its robust use of co-fermentation. Edouard Guerin, technical director at Clos de l’Oratoire, focuses on combining several different terroirs in the same vat. The objective being blending together varieties grown in different soil types to reveal the impact of these unique terroirs. The combination of the signature rolled pebbles (known to impart the classic stewed berry and plum notes) and sandy soils (regarded for producing a more delicate style with silky tannins, fresh black and red fruits with exceptional finesse) is what makes this cuvee such a beautifully crafted alchemy between the purity of fruit, silky mouthfeel and a tremendous depth of character.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Farming beyond the regulations of traditional organic agriculture, the estate – partnering with their neighboring farmer to provide sheep, horse, and cow manure – embraced the challenge of creating their own organic compost rich in micro-organisms. These nourished and living soils result in superior grapes that give rise to living, breathing wines of extraordinary complexity. The vines are pro-created through massal cloning of their best old vine stock, and the vineyard is allowed to flourish with both native grasses and a selected diversity of cover crops, in addition to surrounding hedges, trees, ivy, bushes, wild asparagus, and various other plant species, All of this is to create a thriving environment of flora and fauna that self-regulates the pest and nutrient deficiencies that arise through mono-cropping.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The fruit undergoes traditional fermentation in large oak vats, fully de-stemmed and partially crushed depending on the varietal and lot. Syrah and cinsault are cold soaked for 4-days before allowing for optimal color extraction, while grenache and mourvedre begin immediately. Gentle pump-overs are used to maintain pristine color and delicate freshness throughout. After fermentation, the wine is aged for twelve months in oak vats followed by pre-blending into concrete vats for an additional six to nine months.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The vineyard of Mont de Milieu stands on a hill that used to mark out a boundary between Burgundy and Champagne. It is a south-facing, steeply sloping vineyard, which is essentially a continuation of the sloping hillside of the Grands Crus (including Les Clos, Valmur, Vaudesir, and more). Besson owns just under 2 acres here, so it is one of their smallest production wines. Fourth-generation winemaker Camille Besson loves the extremely small berries from this site’s old vines because of the resulting concentration and depth they provide to the finished wine.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>In comparison to the 2018 vintage we offered previously, the 2019 embraces the slightly cooler growing season (2018 was a very warm vintage), and the increased hang-time on the vine to produce a more classical green apple and gun flint chablis with less overt tropical fruit richness than the prior vintage. What was additionally unique about the 2019 vintage is that the consensus among growers believes the wines actually have greater concentration than the 2018s without sacrificing their inherent freshness, with the grapes picked at slightly higher sugar levels, yet maintaining the region’s renowned acidity. If it weren’t for the tragically low yields (some 50% below an average harvest for the region), a greater deal of buzz would almost certainly be associated with the Chablis offerings of 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was again our favorite of Camille Besson’s Premier Crus with a bright and taut opening of green apples and yellow plums, with crushed lemongrass, and honeydew melon with a fine balance, and utterly scintillating crushed rock finish. It's long, elegant, and angular, subtle spiciness and tremendous complexity. Seriously shocking to have all this at such a price!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Ever fried a whole snapper?

    "description": "<p>We got a smidge more than the Rothenpfad, but still only a handful of cases available. So I’ll give you some tasting notes, then encourage you to go load up on the wine before it sells out. But there’s a lot of super-cool goings on at this estate, so you’ll want to come back to read all about it!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The Fahrlay bursts with a dashing nose of sweet alyssum and honeysuckle, with Meyer lemon, raspberry saltwater taffy, green cardamom, lemongrass, and thyme. Dry, racy, and crisp on the palate, the wine beckons with white grapefruit, smoky flint and salted green plums. Probably the least forward of the wines, this is more subtle, layered and complex, and likely the wine that progresses the most over the coming two decades. I’ll say again, if you like world class riesling...you better go get some of this, quick!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, back to this marvelous estate. The winery was originally built in 1663, across the river from the town of Pünderich, directly on the banks of the Mosel with views over their Marienburg vineyard. Clemens and Rita Busch have built the estate into its current form, alongside their son, Johannes, who has started to work the vines, as well. Clemens is the fifth generation winemaker at this estate (all the previous ones were also named Clemens; he broke the tradition with his son). Clemens started working his father’s 2-hectare estate in 1975 and has spent four decades expanding his holdings to 18 hectares, almost all on the slopes of the Marienburg. Clemens Busch stopped using herbicides in 1976, converting entirely to organic agriculture by 1984. Pioneers amongst the harsh farming and growing conditions in the region, they led the movement to establish an organic grower’s association in 1986, eventually going full biodynamic themselves in 2005. Today, they are members of a number of organic and biodynamic international wine groups, including the “Return to Terroir”, founded by biodynamic guru Nicolas Joly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site for this wine is known as Fahrlay, a composition of vines from 75 to 100 years old on an extremely stony and terraced south-facing slope composed of hard, blue slate. The Rieslings that emerge from this site consistently demonstrate almost salty minerality and are prized for their development over decades. The geology here is based on a volcanic formation hundreds of millions of years old, resulting in a long, undulating cliff face that is the defining characteristic of the Mosel’s steep, rocky vineyards. The three primary slates (blue, red, and grey) are all found here, at different parcels all along the slopes. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In spite of the varied slate profiles and other topography, the German government problematically lumped all these parcels together under one vineyard name, Marienburg, in 1971. Furthermore, they expanded what was a 23-hectare geographically driven site into a 90-hectare politically drawn one, even including a series of flat sites on the opposite side of the river. Clemens has devoted his career to rectifying this mistake, identifying the different terroirs of the original hillside on his labels by their historical names: Fahrlay, Falkenlay, Rothenpfad, Felsterrasse, and Raffes. He further delineates his wines by their soil type, using an ingenious method: the color of the capsule on the bottles indicates the type of slate (blue, gray or red) that dominates the source from which each wine comes. Each vine is tended and harvested by hand, in hazardous conditions of very loose, slick, rock topsoils on very steep slopes. This arduously slow process allows plenty of time to observe the ripening of the berries, and optimal picking, into small baskets, is the result.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Just as important as the team’s work in the vineyard is following through with a careful vinification. The majority of the wines are raised in the traditional Fuder-Fass (1000-liter barrels), though small amounts of stainless steel are used as well. The large barrels provide the yeasts with the necessary air to breathe, allowing fermentation to flow more smoothly, achieving the full extraction of fruit aromas and mineral components. No additives are used, and any mechanical stress is kept to a minimum. Spontaneous fermentations, often requiring a full 8-10 months to complete are the norm, with wines spending a full year or more in barrel before bottling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listed under the Grosses Gewächs (G.G.) designation, which is part Champagne “Special Club” Collection and part Burgundy grand cru… all G.G. wines come from a Grosses Lage (‘great site’) according to the German VDP classification system overseen by a group of producers called the Verband Deutscher Prädikatsweingüter (VDP). Like the grand crus of Burgundy, these wines take the name of the vineyard and not the village. However, more akin to a “Special Club” Champagne, the VDP is an invitation-only, industry body numbering around 200 producers and its rules are not officially part of German wine law. There are limited yields, harvesting methods and overall grape ripeness requirements, and the resulting wine must be dry in order to qualify, with the wines being released on September 1st one year following harvest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Truly one of the world’s great producers, and this, my personal favorite of their consistently epic portfolio of wines. While it lasts!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Seriously, just 10 cases total of this magical ambrosia. For now - this fresh, enchanting wine offers a beautiful nose of golden mango, cantaloupe, Rainier cherry, and dragonfruit – all woven with exotic spices of cardamom, anise, lemongrass, tarragon, and smoky, chipped flint. Voluptuously intense in flavors and overall spiciness – the wine spirals elegantly into a zingy, zesty finish that is quite dry, and also polished amber smooth. Drink over the next 15 years and be blown away at all stages of the wine’s development. In other words… if you like world class riesling… you better go get some of this, quick!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, back to this marvelous estate. The winery was originally built in 1663, across the river from the town of Pünderich, directly on the banks of the Mosel with views over their Marienburg vineyard. Clemens and Rita Busch have built the estate into its current form, alongside their sonS, Florian and Johannes, who have started to work the vines, as well.

A parcel of iron and copper-rich red slate that starts in the Saar, pops up at the Ürziger Würzgarten, Erdener Prälat and Enkircher Steffensberg sites in the Middle Mosel, and ends here, at the Marienburg site that lies at the dividing line between the Middle and Lower Mosel. The geology here is based on a volcanic formation hundreds of millions of years old, resulting in a long, undulating cliff face that is the defining characteristic of Marienburg ’s steep, rocky vineyard. The Rothenpfad site, set just above the Pünderich viaduct, is characterized by slate and iron oxide, which colors the stone a rusty red. The 80+ year old vines are positioned on a southeastern orientation, which helps to mitigate excessive heat, especially during warm growing seasons, like 2020. This site has been revered for over 150 years, even marked as “first category” in ancient maps of the Mosel. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Marienburg contains all three of the Mosel’s primary slates (blue, red, and grey,) at different parcels all along the slopes.

    "description": "<p>This wine showcases the power and concentration typical of the warm 2018 vintage. The wine offers plenty of ripe red fruits, balanced with warm baking spices and subtle oak notes. The power here is intense, begging for a few years of cellaring or a prolonged decant before enjoying. A rare treat with decades of development ahead of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2018 & 2019 are both excellent vintages for Burgundy – especially at the Grand Cru site of Corton. While the warm ‘18 vintage produced concentrated, full-bodied wines that will last a lifetime (or longer), the ‘19 vintage is shaping up to be an all-time classic – with the best sites (like this) combining elegance, endurance, and freshness with seamless integration. You can’t go wrong with either Burghounds and at this price… you probably should do one of each and thank me later!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the northern tip of the revered Cote de Beaune reigns the Hill of Corton. Since the 8th century, wine grapes have been cultivated along the natural amphitheater on the south side of this massive hill, making for the largest grand cru in all of Burgundy. The region was championed centuries ago by Emperor Charlemagne for the exceptionally high quality of its wines and has never looked back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ben Leroux did not come into this world with such an illustrious pedigree. He was born in Beaune to parents who ran a local flower shop, La Violette. At a time when wine jobs (and most others) were passed down through the family, Ben decided from an early age to break the mold and enroll in a trade school to learn how to make wine. A supremely driven and engaged whirlwind of experiences would follow, with stints at Cos d'Estournel in Bordeaux, Domaine Drouhin in Oregon, Louis Jadot in Beaune, and others, finally settling at Comte Armand in Pommard, where he was named technical director and manager at the age of 24! Years later, he would accomplish his ambition of starting his own Domaine, buying a tiny 0.16-hectare parcel of Batard-Montrachet. Built slowly over time, he now owns and farms 8 hectares scattered throughout Burgundy, as well as being a negociant for other parcels of rare Burgundy treasures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether farming the land or purchasing fruit, Ben makes use organic and typically biodynamic techniques (or purchases from those who follow suit). The wines are fermented with up to 30% whole clusters, with native fermentations that last about 3 weeks. The finished wine will age in barrels for up to 22 months, with up to 30% new French oak. These are both powerful wines, with a greater depth and intensity than the 2018, but that is not to mark the 2019 as shy in any way. For now, at least, the 2019 showcases an easy approachability not yet seen in the 2018, but both of these wines are tremendously layered and powerful hallmarks of Corton, with decades of drinking ahead of them. While $150 a bottle is steep for any wine, this is a relative steal for this Grand Cru – a worthy competitor of similarly placed wines costing twice as much!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Grillo is a rare grape variety not often found in the U.S. A cross of two local varieties, cataratto and zibibbo, grillo was once used exclusively for Marsala wine production. Plantings of the grape were in constant decline for 30 years until the legendary Marsala producer Marco de Bartoli decided to vinify grillo on its own as a dry, white wine. From there, as the potential of the grape became more widely recognized, the plantings increased – spreading from the vineyards of Marsala east to the Val di Noto, just south of Syracuse. Grillo is now known for its minerality and ageability, with a weight and texture surpassing pinot grigio, a floral nature reminiscent of viognier, and a structure and acidity to rival White Burgundy’s best plots of chardonnay.</P>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>\"Family and Friends\" is produced from the best lots of grillo, subjected to 6 months of aging, mostly in concrete eggs with a small portion in oak. The wine has abundant aromas of citrus, lavender honey, orange blossom, candied ginger, lemongrass, and sea spray that just pulls you into the glass. The palate is creamy, rich, and laden with minerality, and flavors that echo the aromas harmoniously. The acidity is remarkably vibrant and fresh for such palpable plushness. </P>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The vineyards overlook the Ionian sea and the natural oasis of Vendicari, with Mount Etna visible to the north. These organically farmed, head trained vines thrive in the region's limestone-rich soils – the excessive heat moderated by the cooling influence of ocean-driven winds. The wine was originally made in crazy minuscule quantities… just for family and friends. Over the years, the success of this singular expression of the grillo grape became so fiercely revered by said friends and family that Antonio decided to add it to the portfolio. This is a white wine that shows a harmonious balance of power and elegance, ideally suited for cellaring up to a decade, but approachable with a brief decant in its youth. If the white wines of Sicily are new ground for you, this is among the best examples to showcase the quality of the region’s obscure grape varietals. We have this in very limited quantities, so grab some while you can!</P>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: The best chefs know the meaning of the “K.I.S.S.” philosophy. Keep it simple, stupid! And so we shall with this classic Insalata di Polpo e Patate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Channeling their inner Van Morrison, The Swell Season hits all the jazzy, smooth alt-rock notes with <em>“Low Rising”</em>.",

    "description": "<p>Over the last decade, Pascal Doquet has emerged as a rising star and one of Champagne's premier vignerons. The fruit for this cuvee hails from two of his organically farmed vineyards in the extreme south of the Marne region. Natural farming and supreme dedication to vineyard health are driving forces for Pascal – he is infamous for refusing to discuss vinification methodologies as his true passion is in the vineyards. He even went so far as to buy out his family members, so he could exact control of his agricultural vision without appealing to a committee. His eponymous Domaine has been certified organic since 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Pascal’s vineyards make use of extensive cover crops, and all his inter-vine work is done with a special, ultra-light tractor to avoid any unnecessary compacting of the soil. Plant-based treatments are continuously explored as Pascal attempts to minimize his use of copper and sulfur. He is exceptionally focused on vineyard management in order to express the subtleties of his terroir. His yields are managed through pruning and thinning and almost always come in well below the AOC guidelines. As Pascal often says, “it’s the viticulture that makes the difference, not the vinification.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>In this spirit, the harvest is done by hand, strictly sorting in the vineyards and the cellar. The grapes are pneumatically pressed before fermentation with indigenous yeasts. Most of the fermentation occurs in enamel-lined steel tanks, but some neutral oak is used for the vintage cuvées. The vin-clair is left on the lees for a minimum of five months with minimal bâtonage. Thhe dosage is done without liqueur de tirage, using only a moderate addition of concentrated grape must, closer to the grape's natural sweetness. The dosage level is 3.5 g/liter.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>This wine bursts with energy, verve, and intensity. The nose abounds with roasted pear and baker’s yeast, and the mouth zings with bright and tart green apples, yuzu, lemon cream, and nutmeg. The finish deepens with mineral-laden intensity and a delicately restrained sweetness.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Despite our best efforts, we could only get a spartan ten cases of this beauty. Get it before it’s gone!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: This Champagne serves as the perfect aperitif… bonus points if you follow your glass with this Pear and Gorgonzola Tart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Part 70’s psychedelic rock, part late-stage grunge, Edwyn Collins’ <em>“A Girl Like You”</em> will have you swaying to the groove whilst sipping on this smooth, layered Champagne.",

    "description": "<p>When it comes to off-the-radar small producers, the winemaker's day job can often be a great indicator of the passion project's style, quality, and potential. To wit, winemaker Ryan Pass has been making wine at Farella Vineyard since 2015, taking over as head winemaker for Tom Farella in 2018. The same sort of authentic, minimal intervention and thoughtful winemaking found in Tom’s iconic wines can be discovered in Ryan’s new project Etxea. We live for discoveries like these! 95 points last year, don't wait for the scores for this vintage...it will be long gone. Just 132 cases produced!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Etxea’s cabernet franc hails from the Pickberry Vineyard up at 700ft on Sonoma Mountain (the backside of Napa’s Mount Veeder). For most of its history, the vineyard’s fruit was set aside exclusively for Ravenswood, but in 2012, other clients were added to the roster, such as Gamling & McDuck, Smith Story, and Gail. The vineyard is 30 acres of mixed volcanic soils, set along the rolling hills and slopes on the northern hills of Sonoma Mountain, overlooking the hamlet of Glen Ellen. Cooler than the surrounding Sonoma Valley, the region’s warmth is restrained by cool afternoon breezes from off the Pacific.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>“Etxea” (eh-chay-a) is the Basque word for “house,\" and these wines (we also tasted their terrific albariño) are made to be friendly, affordable wines that are varietally correct, terroir specific, and suitable for daily drinking. This wine is all of that and more, possessing a true and authentic cab franc-ness not often found in California cabernet francs. This drinks very much like a Bourgueil, with a nose of red plums, rhubarb, and squash blossoms...a fresh green aromatic that doesn’t skew vegetal but more green tobacco graphite and fresh earth. The mouth is chock full of rose water, pomegranate, and black tea, with accompanying notes of saddle leather and pink peppercorn. This wine is a perfect nod to the Loire and its historic red grape with medium weight in body, with an uplifting acidity and a soft, mineral-laden finish. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The berries are harvested by hand before de-stemming and undergoing native yeast fermentation on the skins for around three weeks. After gentle pressing and racking, the wine ages in neutral barrels for almost two years. No scores yet for the 2018, but the 2017 vintage received a solid 95 points from Wine Enthusiast, calling the wine <em>“incredibly impressive—a light take on a classic variety from a classic mountain site. Herbal, earthy and floral, it sings on the palate in crisp red fruit, vibrantly fresh texture and lasting elegance.”</p></em>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>We would expect similar praise for this vintage. This is a prime opportunity to get in on what is only the third release of cabernet franc. We secured as much as we could, but as the TOTAL production on this wine is a meager 132 cases, there is just not much to be had. Stylistically, it is made in much the same way as Cali-Loire phenoms Gamling & McDuck’s bottling, though their Pickberry cabernet franc retails at nearly three times the price of what we’re offering here. This is a new producer worth checking out and a wine that all lovers of cabernet franc will enjoy!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: The red fruits, the earthy spice, the vibrant acidity...it all leads me straight to this dish: Borscht with Lamb and Beets. What’s the Ukrainian word for \"delicious\"?!?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: A little something fresh and bright, from right down the highway from Napa… Oakland’s own Rogue Wave with <em>“Lake Michigan”</em>!</p>",

    "description": "<p>The estate’s founding dates back to the late 17th century, during the reign of Louis XIV. Amongst the most powerful wine merchants of the time and steward of Chateau Latour, Pierre Desmezures de Rauzan purchased some nearby plots to offer as dowry for his daughter, Thérèse. She married Baron Jacques Pichon de Longueville in 1694, and this illustrious estate was born. The estate was split in two in 1850, with Baron Raoul Pichon keeping half for himself and handing over the other section to his three sisters, thereafter known as Pichon Comtesse. The famous Renaissance Chateau that graces the estate today was commissioned the following year. The Chateau would be completed soon after receiving prestigious “2nd Growth” status in the Bordeaux official classification of 1855 and proudly stands today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The “Les Griffons” offering was added to the portfolio in 2012. The cabernet dominant wine uses all estate fruit from gravelly plots of land near the Gironde estuary, accounting for roughly 20% of the estate’s production yearly. For the 2018 vintage, the blend resulted in 52% cabernet sauvignon and 48% merlot. The wine ages in 60% in new French barrels, the remaining 40% from once-used barrels for 18 months before bottling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While still early, the 2018 vintage in Pauillac is shaping up to be legendary. A low crop, with warm days, cold nights and great weather through the harvest ensured powerful, structured and fresh wines that will show well early, without sacrificing the ability to cellar over decades. This is a powerful and heady style of cabernet dominant Bordeaux. Delicate and seductive aromas of blackberry, plum, and cassis are elegantly framed with cigar box and clove, leading into a mouth of black cherries, graphite, and mocha. This is one of the greatest values of the stellar 2018 vintage, in a format that allows for immediate enjoyment. Get your share while you can!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: This bold cabernet base shares a lot in common with classic Napa reds, so steak is on the board. Get a nice flavorful cut, like skirt or Zabuton, cooked hot and fast. To serve, add on these Gratin Dauphinoise potatoes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Pete Townshend, Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle and Keith Moon formed one of rock’s greatest quartets back in 1964. To settle on a name, the members sat around taking turns throwing out ideas, with the rest of the group responding, “the who?!?” in chorus. Eventually, it was the chorus that stuck. Here’s one of their all-time bests with <em>“Baba O’Riley”</em>!",

    "description": "<p>Located on the commune of Marsannay La Cote, the golden gateway of the Cote de Nuits, you’ll find Domaine de Vieux College. They do a bit of everything at their estate – from traditional chardonnay and pinot noir, to more esoteric offerings like Marsannay rosé, a Crémant de Bourgogne, and this aligoté (pronounced “al-uh-GO-tay”). A natural cross between pinot noir and the seldom-seen gouais blanc, aligoté was first identified in Burgundy during the 18th century. Particularly well-suited to cold, today the grape has flourished in Eastern Europe and even Russia – with Bulgaria planting over double the amount of aligoté found today in France.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The Vieux College vineyards are fully organic, and raised without the use of any pesticides, herbicides, or fungicides. Organic copper sulfate will be used only to combat mildew, and only as needed. This aligoté is grown on a 2.5 hectare plot with 30-year-old vines. While old vines are ideal for many varietals, they are considered to be especially important for aligoté, as the old vine grapes have a tendency for more weight, mouthfeel and textural complexity – a necessary balancing agent for the grape’s high acidity. The grapes are traditionally fermented, with aging in large, neutral oak vats for 4-6 months prior to bottling.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The wine does not easily lend itself to description or comparison...hence the “geek factor”. Reminiscent of viognier’s floral and red apple aromas, with Chablis’ lemony-ness, picpoul’s quenching acidity, and savagnin’s waxy, wooly texture...this wine pulls your brain and your palate in so many fun and interesting directions simultaneously. The experience is truly unique and decidedly pleasing – certainly a wine meant to be enjoyed in company and discussed with a carefree frivolity. This is a delicious example of a wine that will change the way you think about wine…how many other UNDER $20 bottles can say that?!?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: High acid, rich texture, uniquely sharp...this wine wants some proper, God Save the Queen, pub-style fish and chips! Malt vinegar and tartar sauce on the side, of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Keeping things across the pond, this wine seems the perfect match for the quirky, pop-y and catchy Fab Four... Here’s The Beatles with <em>“8 Days a Week”</em>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>At a wine tasting in New York City, Piero discovered a pinot noir that awakened him to the potential of the Río Negro region of Patagonia, Argentina. After his first visit to the arid, windswept valley, he knew this would be the home of his new passion and turned to his grandfather in Italy for guidance. Piero’s grandfather is the Marchese Mario Incisa della Rocchetta, the legendary creator of Sassicaia. While his grandfather naturally imbued an understanding of fine wines in Piero, more importantly, he taught him about respect for and responsibility to nature. As a pioneer of sustainable farming in Bolgheri, Marchese Mario now serves as a mentor and example to Piero and his new adventure in Patagonia.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<em><p>“The flat, dry Río Negro Valley on the northern end of Patagonia won’t strike anybody as a glamorous wine region. For one thing, apple and pear orchards, along with platoons of poplar trees, far outnumber grapevines. For another, the restaurants, hotels and the usual camp followers of the winemaking life are nowhere to be found. But glamour did not draw Piero Incisa della Rocchetta to the Río Negro. The old pinot noir vines did, along with promising soils, a sparkling climate and a dream of creating a self-sustaining wine estate…”</em> – Eric Asimov, The New York Times</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The 2021 vintage of Cincuenta y Cinco pinot noir marks the third consecutive year the wine received a 98 POINT rating (the prior two years were lowly 97s). This is a remarkable pinot noir with amazing depth and complexity. Floral and spicy aromatics lure you in, with salted cranberry, smoked game, and bergamot tea. Light on its feet, the palate is layered and diverse with rose hips, red alpine berries, iron ore, and Seville orange. </p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Chacra is named for the local dialect’s designation of a special piece of land to pomology (the science of growing fruit). A clear emphasis on farming is the result, with fully organic and biodynamic processes implemented to the highest degree possible. This includes making compost, and an entire series of in-house soil preparations and amendments – from horn manure to yarrow, chamomile, and dandelion “teas” (to name a few) that are all added to the soils and plants as replacements for conventional sprays and fertilizers.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>With meager yields averaging only 2 pounds of fruit from each vine, Piero’s focus has always been on the quality and purity of these biodynamically farmed old vines. Planted in 1955 (hence the name Cincuenta y Cinco), these vineyards grow in the fiercely windy and arid riverbed soils of the Rio Nero, topped with alluvial pebbles. The region receives roughly 6-8 inches of rain per year, relying instead on the snowmelt from the Andes that supplies the two rivers of the region and irrigation for the valley’s agriculture.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The wine is native yeast fermented in whole clusters at some of the coolest temperatures I’ve ever seen for primary fermentation – below 68°F (this is done to emphasize the high-toned floral notes in the wine). The fermentation occurs in shallow cement vats, with the 11 months of aging split evenly between concrete tanks and a mixture of used French oak barrels that have been air-dried for a minimum of 36 months before filling. The wine is racked via gravity, with no additional filtering or fining. From one of the most unique, off-the-radar regions anywhere in the world, this is a shining example of pinot noir, and the potential we hope to see in the years to come. This is some seriously cool stuff that deserves pride of place for your next gathering. Grab yours before it is gone!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Ditch your oven and keep things cool with this Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USIC SUGGESTIONS: Keeping things cool in a completely different (but no less important way) is Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats with <em>“I Need Never Get Old”</em>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Saint-Chamant is an elite grower producer of Champagne that pays homage to an almost forgotten style. While these wines are luxuriously rich and complex chardonnay-based cuvees from mostly Grand Cru plantings in Chouilly, the most unique thing about them is their elevage and disgorgement. Methods were set in place by the esteemable Christian Coquillette, who ran the estate for nearly 70 years before passing away in 2020. He made the wines, tended the caves, and even took on the arduous task of riddling every single bottle (!) all by himself, and all by hand...FOR HIS ENTIRE CAREER! His son Stephane has agreed to carry on this legacy himself – paying respect to one of Champagne’s all-time great characters. Only 15 cases are available, and with this house’s reputation…that could move quickly!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Across the portfolio, one constant for Saint-Chamant is their exceptionally long time spent in the bottle prior to disgorgement. The bottles are stored in the ancient, winding caves beneath the house, only disgorging the wines (again, by hand) when the wine is sold. Christian continued doing this well into his 80s, in his always dapper attire and signature wiry mustache, using his gnarled and fiercely strong hands to add the final touch to each and every bottle of Saint-Chamant.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>As always, Saint-Chamant exceeds expectations with this robust and perfectly mature Champagne that simply boggles even the most vinously educated minds. A beautifully pale golden liqueur, dense with fine mousse and deliciously small bubbles – this champagne oozes the classiness of wines twice the price. Deep and heady aromas of brioche dough, Marcona almonds, and pear brandy delight the senses turning to candied ginger, Meyer lemon meringue, baked apples, and lightly browned butter on the palate. The flinty minerality and quivering acidity uplift the entire wine, giving an almost unexplainable lightness to such a headstrong and full wine. This is that Champagne you don’t want to end, but somehow that makes it disappear all the faster. Truly remarkable bubbles…to delight any Champagne lover! Get them while you can!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: This is a simple one from a good Ukrainian friend of mine: Brioche bread, spread with an ample dollop of room temperature butter (splurge on some quality, salted butter like Kerrygold or Plugra), with a healthy smattering of cured salmon roe. Take the sip before the bite and wait for the magic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Queen is really one of the best, hardest to categorize bands of all-time. <em>“Don’t Stop Me Now”</em> is the legendary band at their upbeat best.</p>",

Charmingly mustached and quite dapper, octogenarian Christian specializes primarily in Blanc de Blancs with more than 28 acres of Chardonnay vineyards in Grand Cru Chouilly. The house also makes a small amount of rosé, from 92% Chardonnay and 8% Pinot Meunier from Épernay. Christian is a firm believer in extended lees aging, and he disgorges only once the wines have been ordered.

      "description": "\"Champagne Saint Chamant was established in 1930 by Pierre and Hélène Coquillette. Their son, Christian, took over the estate in 1950. Located in Épernay, the house’s unsigned, unassuming exterior in no way hints at its labyrinthine cellar, built in the early 19th century, which is a mile long-and lined with hundreds of thousands of carefully aging Champagne bottles. Charmingly mustached and quite dapper, octogenarian Christian specializes primarily in Blanc de Blancs with more than 28 acres of Chardonnay vineyards in Grand Cru Chouilly. The house also makes a small amount of rosé, from 92% Chardonnay and 8% Pinot Meunier from Épernay. Christian is a firm believer in extended lees aging, and he disgorges only once the wines have been ordered. All Saint Chamant Champagnes are of a distinctive style and sophisticated quality, reflecting well the elegance and refinement of their maker. They display a heady, old-time richness and vinosity with extremely fine bubbles.\""

    "description": "<p>Tracy and Peter Joachim Nielsen were inspired by a small family property in the south of France named \"la pitchoune\", or \"the little one.\" The name speaks to small production, small lots, and the idea that small size is the greatest asset…with a scant few hundred cases made, this Sonoma Coast chardonnay is a great find that always over-delivers. Sourced from two prime vineyards in the Sonoma Coast, Falcon Crest (near the town of Graton) and the legendary Pratt Vineyard near Sebastopol. Both vineyards lie a mere 6 miles from the Pacific Ocean, with Falcon planted to Wente clones (California heritage clones originally selected from Montrachet vines in Burgundy) and Pratt relying on Robert Young and Mt. Eden chardonnay clones.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>With enticing aromas of lemon verbena, mandarin blossom, river rock and bread dough, this wine starts with a subtle attraction that soon turns to a plush lustiness – loaded with yellow plums, gala apples, ocean spray, and roasted fennel. The wine deftly balances an Old World homage with the purity of character that California demands of its grapes…respecting both, yet submissive to neither.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The wine is crafted to make a style of wine Robert Parker described as <em>“impressive, Burgundian-style Chardonnay (think Bâtard-Montrachet)”</em> -- through picking grapes on the early side to retain acidity and freshness, fermenting and aging in mostly used French oak barrels, bottling unfined and unfiltered, and aging the wine at least an extra year in bottle before release. The wine ages 16 months in barrel, with only 10% new oak. This is a complex and age-worthy Cali-chardonnay, with a perfect balance of brightness and weight that should allow this to develop harmoniously over the next 7 years or so. Spectacular now, and at this remarkable price, sure to be snatched up quickly! Get it while it lasts!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: I once dated a girl who didn’t like tacos...obviously, it didn’t work out. Who doesn’t like tacos?!?! These shrimp tacos are the perfect fit for this crisp and layered chardonnay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Balance is key...in chardonnay, but also in music. A little bit o’ twang, a dollop of rock, and a touch of Southern blues makes Chris Stapleton’s <em>“When The Stars Come Out”</em> a genre-defying hit.</p>",

The story goes, that one day, a patient in her care was prepping for a dangerous, high-risk procedure. He also happened to be the proprietor of a famous Napa vineyard. Upon learning about her home-winemaking passion, he struck a karma-increasing deal...if the procedure went off without a hitch, four rows of his famous cabernet sauvignon would be hers to make as she saw fit. And, here we are!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Now made at Bart and Daphne Araujo's Wheeler Family winery facility (which is also an ultra-premium custom crush operation), Cathleen happily soaks up wine-making tips and guidance from some of the best in the business. This is a tremendous discovery for all lovers of classically endowed Napa cabernet. Flavors of hoisin sauce, blackberry pie, elderberry liqueur, chocolate-dusted raspberries, toasted black pepper, and more! Great concentration with a harmonious balance of fruit and structure. This is drink-me-up, powerful Napa cabernet at its best...for a price that can’t be beat!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>82% Sleeping Lady Vineyard is the elephant in the room here...since the Bettinelli family purchased this vineyard in 2013 – one that they stewarded (on behalf of far larger winery players) for decades – this vineyard has quickly become home to some of the most desirable fruit in Napa. No fewer than three multiple 100-point winemakers make cabernet from this hallowed ground, including Benoit Touquette (Realm), Francoise Peschon (Araujo, Vine Hill Ranch), and Julien Fayard (Purlieu). That they are now joined by a retired nurse and salt-of-the-earth person like Cathleen, well, that just confirms everything we love about the wine industry. This vineyard sits at the western edge of the Yountville AVA, tucked in the shadow of an undulating ridge of the Mayacamas range, whose shape inspired the vineyard’s name. The soil was formed by a once a fast-moving river that deposited jagged rocks and sand from miles away and created a thick layer of gravel beneath the topsoil – providing exceptional drainage and optimal stress – and yielding small, concentrated berries with layered complexity.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>This is a wine meant to be shared – a word-of-mouth gem that we are thrilled to have discovered...now it’s your turn! 50% OFF, top-notch cabernet sauvignon with this sort of pedigree...what are you waiting for?!?! While it lasts!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: We’re feeling Nigerian Suya...a street food of highly seasoned grilled beef skewers that are sure to become a feather in your cap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Yeah, <em>“Free Bird”</em> is great, <em>“Sweet Home Alabama”</em> too... but <em>“Simple Man”</em>... Lynyrd Skynyrd at their very, very best.",

    "description": "<p>Stop the presses. It's HERE! We've been eagerly waiting on this one; we even enlisted the kid who tracks Elon Musk's plane to watch the cargo ship move safely across the Atlantic. Bruno Giacosa – Piemonte's most legendary producer – and his 2016 Barolo, \"Vigna Le Rocche Riserva\" from the amazing Falletto parcel in the Serralunga d'Alba!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly, Bruno Giacosa passed away at 88 years of age back in 2018. He never had the chance to see the bottled final product of the amazing 2016 vintage, though we are certain he was aware – perhaps more so than anyone, what a special vintage it was. This is one of the finest wines in Giacosa’s long and storied history – and if you know anything about this producer, you know that is saying something, indeed.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>For many, Giacosa’s red label “Riservas” are the best red wines anywhere in the world. He made them only a few times a decade, to the extent that his spectacular vintages of his white label wines were scrutinized by critics for what possible flaw could have prevented them from achieving the rarified riserva status. To Bruno, in the end, he alone knew what the difference was, and he was famously reticent to describe his method in specific detail. Whatever the case may be, there is no doubt that these supremely rare and valued red-label wines are fantastically complex, unequivocally powerful, and decadently rich wines capable of decades, literally decades, of development. Wine Advocate (be sure to read the review below) put a drinking window of 2025 all the way to 2055 (and most would argue even that it is on the shorter side of the actual livelihood of this remarkable wine).</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>This is as collectible as any wine we’ve ever featured, truly. The fruit from this hails from the oldest plots of vines in the cru of Falletto – a monopole site owned exclusively by Giacosa (and not to be confused with Castiglione Falletto) just outside of the village of Serralunga. I wish I could say that I got to taste this wine...but even many of the top wine critics in the world don’t get to taste this unicorn. Read the critics who did get to taste it below, and I’m sure you’ll agree… if you can get a wine like this, by hook or by crook, you absolutely, positively, unquestionably, should do just that.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Just 25 miles down the road from their Domaine Drouhin estate (and a cool 8,250 from their Maison Drouhin estate in Beaune), the Drouhin family purchased the Roserock property in 2013. Set on a south-facing hill in the extreme southern edge of Oregon’s Eola-Amity Hills AVA, this gorgeous estate is 305 sprawling acres – with 122 acres planted to vine. Pinot noir is king here – planted on 111 acres with 35 distinct blocks of the grape.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>This blend is comprised of the finest barrels from the estate and is named for the fragrant “Zéphirine Drouhin” variety of thornless climbing roses. Quite fittingly, the dark-ruby Zéphirine pinot has an intense perfume of red roses, with violets, wild strawberries, hibiscus, clove, and cocoa powder. Over 140 years of world-class winemaking is clearly on display, with profound complexity and ethereal elegance found in every corner of this scintillating pinot noir.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>During the growing season, cool ocean breezes are funneled along the Van Duzer Corridor through Oregon’s Coast Range every evening, moderating the heat of this part of the Eola-Amity Hills and making the area more than ten degrees cooler than the northern Willamette Valley. These maritime winds make for lively acidity and distinct freshness in the fruit, producing delicate and fresh flavors. The Roserock soils are based on ancient lava flows that have decomposed into volcanic basalt soils that are fast-draining and incredibly rocky. The block partitioning of the vineyard allows for slight variations in soil consistency, angle, and aspect to be reflected in the flavors and characteristics of each block, providing an opportunity for each section to be selected for this top cuvee – changing from year to year.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>This stands as one of the best Oregon pinots we’ve tasted in some time, and we’re thrilled to have some to share with you. Not as much as we would like, of course, so do all that you can to grab some of these before they’re gone. We promise you won’t regret it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Duck, of course! Watch this quick video on how to cook the perfect duck breast, thin out some nice plum jam with some chicken stock and red wine, bring that to a simmer and serve it all with some roasted vegetables. Viola!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: My wife suggested this, and pretty much nailed it… Brandi Carlile with <em>“The Story”</em>.",

    "description": "<p>Who’s ready for Champagne?!?! Lamiable is a terrific, under-the-radar grower-producer from the eastern edge of the Vallée de la Marne, just below Bouzy. This brut nature cuvee titled “seed of stars” is a precise and penetrating offering of top-notch Champagne that you won’t find anywhere else in the U.S.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lamiable family settled in the village of Tours-sur-Marne back in the 18th century. The family has always farmed the region, though it wasn’t until after World War II that the family turned to plant their own grapes. These wines from the family holdings are extremely limited in production, so rare that they are not submitted to critics for review, and are near impossible to find outside of Europe. This is spectacularly delicious grower Champagne that will be greatly appreciated by the illustrious few that get a chance to taste them.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>This cuvee is a blend of the Grand Cru territories of Tours-sur-Marne and neighboring Bouzy. The Lamiable family’s first parcel of vines was planted in Tours-sur-Marne in a place called “Les Vignes des Meslaines” that has become their signature plot, with a percentage blended into nearly all of their wines as a sort of calling card (similar to Pierre Gimonnet and their “Cuis” site). The winery is in a small wine-producing village in the pinot noir dominant Montagne de Reims, just north of Tours-sur-Marne and west of Bouzy. Set in the shadow of the 70-million-year-old Mount Sinai, the tallest point of the Montagne de Reims, this village inherits a cross-section of geology focused on chalk, sand, clay, and limestone that lends the area’s Champagne their characteristic features.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>This zero dosage Champagne clocks in at 60% pinot noir and 40% chardonnay. 40% of the wine comes from a perpetual reserve, crafted solera style and going back a few decades. After 4 years on the lees, the resulting wine is compact, fresh, and concentrated in flavors with hints of white grapefruit, lime zest, and flint. As the bottle settles, creamy notes of toasted hazelnuts and buttered brioche reveal themselves, with fierce tension and uplifting acidity throughout. This is a rare steal of a find for spectacular grower Champagne. Don’t miss this!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Bring this to your next sushi outing. Bone dry with a delicate mousse, this will zip perfectly with the day’s omakase menu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Speaking of sushi, I grew up going to a killer spot in Newport Beach that had an amazing ritual… every night at 7 pm, they’d pass out wooden blocks to the patrons, dim the lights and play <em>“In the Air Tonight”</em> by Phil Collins. You’d clap along with your blocks, take a bite of Yellowtail and drink your drank! Good times.</p>",

    "description": "<p>If you know high-end Champagne, Les Crayeres is a vineyard of exceptional status that needs to be on your radar. This 100% pinot noir plot in Ambonnay produces some of the most powerful Champagnes around. Here, in the hands of one of our favorite growers, in this vintage, extra brut, Grand Cru Blanc de Noir at an incredible value – easily competing with similar wines that fetch two to three times this price (or more…looking at you, Krug Clos d’Ambonnay!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>100% pinot noir, aged in 205 liter Champagne barrels and bottled without filtration… this is both a beauty and a beast! Powerfully rich, impressively intense, and playfully elegant, this Champagne is exceptional even in its youth! Enticing aromas of honeysuckle, toasted brioche, spiced and roasted green apples, candied grapefruit, crushed oysters…and on, and on…this wine is nearly as much fun to smell as it is to taste. Luckily, you don’t have to choose, and the wine leads to a pure, expressive palate of lemon cream, cherry saltwater taffy, strawberries, toasted almonds, and more…all harnessed by rigid tension and penetrating minerality. Just wow!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seriously, this wine is a steal! Paul Dethune makes this from one and a half hectares of pinot noir on Les Crayeres’ powerful, south-facing, chalky slope planted to over 50-year-old vines. The Dethunes are the second oldest Champagne family in Ambonnay, with an unbroken history of growing grapes in the region going back to 1610! That’s the same year Galileo discovered three moons of Jupiter, folks. History, pedigree, location…this wine has the resume that would rival any producer in Champagne. So yes, a $120 bottle of Champagne is a deal! Egly-Ouriet makes their non-vintage cuvee from an adjacent plot that goes for $260+ per bottle. We won’t even talk about the price of Krug’s Clos d’Ambonnay, just a stone’s throw away… (side note: the word “crayère” means chalk pit and is a common term throughout Reims, so beware of cheaper look-alikes that don’t actually hail from this tiny Grand Cru site!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like each of his forebears, Pierre Dethune has created his own style of Champagne – rooted in tradition yet ever-evolving – the one constant being the grassy lands of Ambonnay. Over the past few years, the Dethune portfolio has gradually lowered the total dosage – moving below the 6g/liter allotment and transitioning the wines to Extra Brut or below (even when labeled as Brut). This bottling is a zippy 5g/liter. The shift has produced an enhanced freshness and verve to the finished wines without sacrificing the purely ripe fruit orchard characteristics that are definitively Ambonnay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neighbors of legends like Egly-Ouriet and Billiot, this is ground zero for the world's best Blanc de Noirs. The vineyard practices natural and organic techniques such as integrated pest management, solar power, and a complete lack of chemical use in the vineyard. Ambonnay is arguably the center point of the grower Champagne movement and host to numerous small farmers following the path laid forth by the Dethunes. We got as much as we could, but high-end Champagnes at a price like this tend to move quickly, so do what you must to grab a few before they’re gone!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Steak. Seriously. Get yourself a beautiful Hanger steak (or filet, if you must), simply season with good salt, and sear in a cast iron skillet. While it rests, make this classic bearnaise sauce…slice, season with some flaky salt, and be amazed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: This is probably the closest thing to a Taylor Swift song you’ll find here… Country legend Ryan Adams covered every song from Taylor’s <em>“1989”</em> album… giving each song his own unique twist. Here’s <em>“Wildest Dreams”</em>.</p>",

The wine is all barrel aged, resulting in a “mature” style of Champagne that abounds with complexity – spicy, savory, and earthy tones, with the faintest whisper of oxidation adding even further depth. This is comparable in style to Krug or Jacques Selosse, at a price tag nowhere near those other wines! If ever a nearly $70 bottle of Champagne could be championed for its incredible value, this is that champion!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Located in the pristine hamlet of Ambonnay and is one of only 17 villages rated as \"Grand Cru\" in the whole of Champagne. Pierre and Sophie Déthune have become known for their powerful yet delicate wines. The vineyard practices natural and organic techniques such as integrated pest management, solar power, and a complete lack of chemical use in the vineyard. Ambonnay is arguably the center point of the grower champagne movement and host to numerous small farmers following in the path laid forth by the Dethunes.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The pinot noir takes the lead in this bottling, with a nose of summer strawberries and raspberries, followed by floral notes of peach blossoms and preserved lemons. On the palate, the wine showcases spicy ginger and nutmeg with a warm woodsy note. The finish is dry, lush, and creamy. This is powerful, heady, and thought-provoking stuff that seriously delivers (or, rather, over-delivers) for the price! Only 30 cases are available, so get some before it is gone!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: With cooler days on the horizon (about time!), I’m looking forward to fall. The perfect dish for this? Creamy Pumpkin Soup...and go ahead and ignore the recipe on this...the crème fraîche is NOT optional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: <em>“Come and join the party – dressed to kill…”</em> It’s like Roger Daltrey of The Who was channeling me, in my long-stowed fall attire best, showing up to a post-harvest celebration with this show stopping bottle of wine. <em>”Eminence Front”</em>, indeed!</p>",

    "description": "<p>If you love ethereal, delicate wines of restraint and austerity...just move along, nuttin' to see here. But if vinous hedonism is your jam, if you crave unapologetically powerful and ripe wines that set your hair on end, well, my friends, you are in luck! “Protege” is the product of Ryan Darrall and Mathew Torres, long-time locals who grew up in cellars and vineyards throughout Napa. Ryan is part of the Wagner family and started working at Caymus before he graduated middle school. Mathew hails from the Trinchero family, one of Napa’s longest-standing “first families” of wine, who has spent considerable time learning the ropes at the family’s various vineyards and winemaking facilities throughout the valley. Take that combined length of exposure, add on the access to small lots of world-class fruit, with the generational passion of all things wine coursing through their veins, and you have an opportunity for stellar, remarkable, in-your-face wine.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Oh, and 2016... perhaps the best vintage in the last two decades (each rich with great vintages like 2007, 2012, 2013, 2014, and on...) for a cherry on top? That’s what we’re offering here. This is a juicy, plush blend of syrah, cabernet sauvignon, and petite sirah – heady, inky, rich, and crowd-pleasing to its very core. Decadent Tahitian vanilla, berry compote, coffee bean, sticky buns fresh out the oven, and licorice – all coming together for a bold, luscious wine that just flows effortlessly across the tongue. Spectacular stuff! This is the very, very last of this wine, and we pulled every ace out of our sleeve to get the last of it here for you. Wine Spectator captured it perfectly in their 92-point review below.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is a flashy, pedal-to-the-medal style of Napa red – a perfect contender to unseat The Prisoner in the hearts and minds of the captivated, red blend aficionados of the world. At 25% below retail and drinking perfectly here and now, you’ll want to snag this before it is gone for good!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: This wine would sing with something that has depth, intensity, smokiness, and a deeply roasted savory edge...enter <a href=\"https://www.rickbayless.com/recipe/oaxacan-black-mole/\">Oaxacan Mole Negro</a> – the king of mole, in my opinion. Serve it alongside roast chicken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: While that mole simmers away, you can listen to the lion’s share of Pink Floyd’s entire collection, but be sure not to miss <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3J_2R9rAp8\"><em>“Fearless”</em></a> from the 1971 album Meddle.</p>",

    "description": "<p>It's that time of year again! Every year we yearn for the moment our Vacheron allocation arrives and today is the day! Our allocation gets smaller and smaller and the price continues to climb as demand for these wines has reached fever pitch. The last vintage racked up a superb 96 point score from Wine Advocate (the review for the 2020 is coming any day now), the Guigne Chevre is cellar-worthy in a way that few dry sauvignon blancs could claim, this offering is further proof that Sancerre is more desirable than ever. The Vacherons are a tour-de-force making the finest wines in their long history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Vacherons have reached the top of the Sancerre pyramid, with few peers anywhere in the Loire as respected and admired. This new single-vineyard bottling of Guigne Chevres is always one of our favorites, and the glorious 2020 vintage is no exception. First, the bad news: this is one of the smallest parcels in the Vacheron’s single-vineyard series, and while we’ve worked some magic to get the lion’s share of everything imported to the U.S. – that is still just a shade over 10 cases. But, we just couldn’t wait any longer to share this singular wine with you, so you’re gonna have to trust us and grab yours before they’re gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s a lot going on at the moment in the town of Sancerre much of it, thanks to the Vacheron family. Currently in construction, the new Vacheron multi-million dollar state of the art winery, restaurant, and hospitality center will serve as a statement to the great white wine producers of the world – don’t sleep on Sancerre. The Vacheron estate has always been known for making wines of dazzling purity and elegance, but since this fourth generation pair of Jean-Laurent and Jean-Dominique took over day-to-day operations, Vacheron has ratcheted up to become the very best producer of Sancerre (our opinion, of course, but one shared by many and more everyday)!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>“Jean-Dominique and Jean-Laurent Vacheron have blown, like fresh air, a breath of biodynamics across their 48 hectares of vineyard since they took over the estate from their parents. In almost the same breath, they have turned it into one of the most respected estates in the region. Their cellars at the top of the hill in Sancerre have a romantic charm…Beyond their lovely Sauvignon Blancs, they also have 11 hectares of Pinot Noir and make some of the most admirable red wines of the central Loire.”</em> - Joel Payne, Vinous</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guigne Chèvres is located just around the corner from the family’s foundational ‘Les Romains’ vineyard on a northeast-facing slope near the summit of the exposed hilltop. The extreme winds have caused these 30-year-old vines to grow very close to the ground, reminiscent of a series of bonsai shrubs, staggered across the silex dominant soils, mixed with red clay and limestone. The site's name comes from the local French patois, meaning “to look at goats”, as the steep slope remains a favorite grazing spot among the local herds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a striking, aromatically rich, refined, and seamless sauvignon blanc that flat out purrs with aromas of white peach, grapefruit zest, golden plum, struck flint, tarragon and lime leaf. Silky mouthfeel, with an impressive weight, density, tension, and electric verve that bodes for a long and beautiful development over the next 15 years…easy.</p>",

    "description": "<p>We’re thrilled to have gotten anything from this amazing producer...one of the oldest Saint-Emilion producers, with a wine that is one of their best efforts to date! 97 points and a cool 37% OFF, this is one to treasure and hoard!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>“It's hands down the finest wine I've tasted from this estate…”</em> - Jeb Dunnuck. So...that’s good, right? You bet! This is a remarkable estate that consistently gets scores from the critics in the low to mid-90s range. Clearly stepping things up a notch with the spectacular 2018 vintage, this wine is one of the best Bordeauxs of the vintage...at nowhere near the price of its competition. Heady, intense, and brooding – loaded with blackberry, black plum, cherries, blood orange, mint, violets, truffle, and black currant, the wine is stimulating, thought-provoking, and downright entrancing. Rich, plush, and mouth-coating, but not heavy, this is everything you hope for in a glass of world-class wine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spread across 30 hectares just outside of the village of Saint-Emilion, the terroir is mostly the remnants of a clay and limestone plateau, with additional clay hillsides above and sandy foothills below. Planted dominantly to merlot (63%), and then followed classically by cabernet franc (28%) with smaller plots of cabernet sauvignon (7%) and malbec (2%). The vine material averages 30+-years-old, planted in orderly rows. In fact, the estate is known for being among the first vineyards to be planted in rows – a concept that is undoubtedly commonplace today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a soil depth of only 30 centimeters, the soil is annually turned over, once to bring what little nutrient material exists up to the surface and then again in the opposite direction to smooth out the landscape. The harvest occurs by hand, with all berries de-stemmed and processed through the gravity-flow winery for fermentation in large wooden tanks. For the 18 months elevage, the wine is transferred to 60% new French barrels and 40% once-used barrels, with roughly 50% of the wine undergoing malolactic fermentation during this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the perfect opportunity to get to know a historic estate as they evolve to turn out the best wines in its long history. With a complete renovation of the property in the last ten years, this estate is one to watch in Saint-Emilion and one to visit as well! Just fantastic stuff to drink now and anytime over the next 20+ years! While it lasts!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: If you’ve ever been to Napa, hopefully you stopped in at Cindy Pawlcyn’s famous Mustards Grill. Her life-changing, succulent, and savory Mongolian Pork Chops are perfect for this. Serve with braised red cabbage and roasted carrots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: This wine strikes me as soulful and powerfully romantic...so we’re going with one of my all-time favorite love songs: <em>“Cover Me Up”</em> by Jason Isbell.</p>",

    "description": "<p>\"Year in and year out, this is one of the superstar wineries, not only in Napa Valley and all of California but in the entire world... One of the world’s great wines and profound expressions of Cabernet Sauvignon. The quality of the wines soared to first-growth standards, and have remained there for the last twenty-plus years.” - Robert Parker </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The year was 2004, and I had an opportunity to buy several bottles of 1978 Shafer Cab (first vintage!) and it was, and is, a revelation. Simply put, nothing has changed. These wines, from the quiet masterwork winemaking of Elias Fernandez (truly, one of the greatest people and winemakers in the Valley), remain rock-solid, polished, powerful and beautifully well-made wines in the entire Valley, year after year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2018 Hillside is a stunning wine from a pitch-perfect vintage. Always an early site, these south-facing hillside vineyards were fully picked before the fires. There are few wines in the world that can match the consistency and excellence of Hillside Select. Grown on the rocky, volcanic hillsides of the Stag's Leap palisades o the winery 60+ acre estate, the intensity, purity and silky tannins are a signature of this site. </p>",

    "description": "<p>Domaine de L’ile Margaux is one of the coolest vineyards ever. Originally a part of the iconic Chateau Margaux estate going back to the 1855 classification (it is quite literally a five wood away), this island was annexed from the Chateau in 1999 and sold soon after to the Favarel family. This 2000 vintage, a remarkable year for Bordeaux, is drinking beautifully at a full two decades since bottling. You won’t find this anywhere else in the U.S. – and how often do you find 20+ year old Margaux, with this sort of pedigree, at this incredible price?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This vineyard occupies a teardrop shaped island of about 20 hectares in the Gironde estuary system. The Favarel family has 14 hectares of vines planted – at a mind-boggling 1.5 meters BELOW sea level. The border of the island is surrounded by over 360 varieties of fruit trees planted on a raised berm to minimize wind and flooding. The soil make up is a special hydrogeological structure – a gradual sedimentation of blue clay and sand layers that are hydrated and drained 4 times each day, following the natural rhythm of the tides. This unique environmental condition protects the vines against heat and water stress. Just wild stuff, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But let’s get to it… the wine is delicious! We tasted through a vertical of these wines almost a year ago now and the 2000 was, without question, the best wine in the 10+ vintages that we tasted. Seriously, cool stuff going on in the glass – classic Bordeaux profile that joins rich berry notes with a mineral edge and earthy undertones. It even has that pure, indescribable Margaux-ness… *shakes head in disbelief*. The aromas are mature with notes of forest floor, rose petal, dried morel mushrooms, coffee beans, pencil lead, and saddle leather. In the palate, the wine roars to life – showcasing red cherries and raspberries, sandalwood, soy, fig jam, and black olives. This is nuanced, complex, and contemplative juice with a long finish that maintains a youthful grip, soft but chalky tannins, and ample, lively acidity. You’ll be blown away!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vineyard is planted mostly to merlot (~45%) followed by smaller amounts of cabernet sauvignon (~20%) and then petit verdot, cabernet franc, and malbec. The Faravel family has been quietly producing this singular wine since 2000, and reinvesting in the land and island since their purchase of the property in 2001. They have recently received organic certification in 2015, and have always been fully committed to sustainable farming practices (I suppose when your vineyard is planted below sea level, you kind of have to, right?). This is one of the cooler finds for us in some time, and something that is not to be missed by any true Bordeaux fan! While it lasts!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: This savory wine makes me crave steak in the most cave-man way. I’m thinking a strip steak, cooked over a live fire, with this Sherry Mushroom Cream Sauce...ok, I’m hungry again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Full transparency...I picked this song, because I imagine these vines felt <em>“Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed”</em> once the island resurfaced from the depths in the early winter of 2000...but is David Bowie really ever the wrong call? Methinks not.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Arguably the most prestigious Burgundy house in Volnay, Domaine de la Pousse d’Or has been around since the 1100s, when it was called Bousse d’Or or “Golden Earth”. At one time, the domaine included such notable properties as Romanée-Conti and Clos de Tart (I know, right?!?). By the early 20th century, the estate had fallen into disrepair, eventually resurrected by the legendary Gérard Potel, who acquired it in the 1960s. Under his direction, the estate rose to prominence, becoming the powerhouse that is at once historical and modern Burgundy at the highest level.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>These two wines showcase the consistency of quality that the estate sets forth from all of their holdings. One Chambolle Musigny Village that far outperforms its station, sourced from a handful of perfect plots (and some choice premier cru fruit), and another Corton-Bressandes Grand Cru, from 30-50 year old vines on the prestigious hill of Corton. These are exceptional examples of Burgundian modern style – powerful, ripe, and rich, with the structure to develop over the decades. Fair warning! These are very limited, with only a few cases of each. Don’t miss out!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Château Pape-Clément is among the oldest of Bordeaux’s Grand Crus, with harvests dating back to 1252! Newly arrived, ex-Chateau, pristine, and just starting to show its stuff…this is dramatic and finely-crafted wine any way you slice it, a must-have Bordeaux at a tempting price!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Château Pape-Clément estate is the oldest planted vineyard in the region and has a wonderful history that includes its namesake, the Archbishop of Bordeaux, Bertrand de Got, who became Pope Clément V in 1305. Today, under the direction of the one and only Bernard Magrez, the wines of Pape-Clément have never been better. 98 POINTS, plus 97, two 96s, double 95s…clearly the critics hate this wine. We’ll let the reviews below speak for themselves, but this should be on every serious Bordeaux drinkers list, no question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a blend of 60% merlot, 36% cabernet sauvignon, 3% petit verdot and 1% cabernet franc, Château Pape-Clément’s grand vin is unique for the AOC of Pessac-Leognan. Like most of Graves, reds here are more typically based on cabernet sauvignon, with merlot in a supporting role. However, with the estate concentrating on lower yields and picking overall riper fruit than in years past, merlot has become the prize of these vineyards, ripening somewhat earlier than the long-hanging cabernet. Their distance from the Gironde estuary and the drained marshlands of Pauillac and the rest of Medoc also creates an environment ideally suited towards merlot’s prowess here. Much of this is due to lower yields and then judiciously selecting only the best fruit for fermentation. After 30-40 days of maceration and 18 months of barrel aging, the wine is blended and bottled – and ready to surprise and delight the most discerning of Bordeaux enthusiasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Revel in delicately layered aromas of violets, and graphite, and earthy tobacco, punctuated with notes of creme de cassis and shaved truffles. On the palate, this is expansive and rich, with beguiling flavors of orange peel, blackberry, kirsch, black tea, and red plums. An undercurrent of freshly crushed rocks adds to the length and focus of the long, dry finish. This is a polished and powerful red with a spicy headiness that reels the senses. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just 15 cases! Get a few for your collection while they last!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food Pairing: Cindy Pawlcyn’s beloved Backstreet Kitchen in Napa Valley may be closed, but this Chinatown Duck Burger recipe is immortal. A perfect match for this savory and plush Bordeaux!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Music Suggestion: A classic French wine deserves a timeless French singer. Enjoy Edith Piaf’s “Milord”</p>",

    "description": "<p>It’s madness not to have this in your cellar at $149.95! 2019 vintage, 100-pointer, and a BIG-time Bordeaux beauty to be treasured! This limited new parcel of Pontet-Canet is sensational... get a few to drink and a few to lay down as an investment! A legend in the making!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did we say 100 points? Well, it’s also JS99, D98, WE97-99, etc., etc. So, yeah…Chateau Pontet Canet! Led by the irrepressible Alfred Tesseron, who famously brought the Chateau back into rockstar status during the 90s (when most of the First Growths with similar press were selling for 3-4 times as much). Leaving behind conventional vine growing techniques in order to embrace organic and biodynamic methods, they have allowed the terroir to reclaim its origins. Speaking of terroir, Pontet Canet happens to be perfectly situated in Paulliac’s gravelly Rodeo Drive, next to Mouton Rothschild.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2019 Bordeaux Vintage is one for the ages. At En Primeur, which serves as the sort of debutante ball for each new vintage of Bordeaux, seasoned critics, vintners, and lucky interlopers like me were absolutely gobsmacked at the amazing offerings from all the top estates – the freshness, the lift, the refined power, just brilliant! Pontet Canet was undoubtedly one of the highlights, with an elegance and purity that sets this wine as potentially one of the best ever for the historic estate. With a blend of 65% cabernet sauvignon, 30% merlot, 3% cabernet franc, and 2% petit verdot, the wine just offers EVERYTHING - power, balance, harmoniousness, concentration, elegance… and more. A few choice snippets from the critics: <em>“...Particularly successful during En Primeur, and even better now, just bursting out of the glass…Such gorgeous aromatics of freshly picked violets, cherries, and bramble fruits - pretty and quite delicate…The length is rather endless…This is just such a great wine, everything you want and you know there's power there promising a long life.”</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I couldn’t have said it better myself! Not much to go ‘round, unfortunately, and with a pedigree like this, in a monumental vintage like 2019… move quickly is my best advice! While it lasts!</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>“Unquestionably one of the top estates in France is that of brothers Thierry and Jean-Pierre Usseglio...”</em> - Jeb Dunnuck. Darn straight, Jeb. The Domaine of Pierre Usseglio, run by the third-generation team of Thierry and Jean-Pierre, is one of the finest estates to be found anywhere. The family has 25 hectares of prime vineyards in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, plus other plots throughout Southern Rhone to work with, mostly old vines that start at 40 years of age and go to well over 65. In an absolutely banner vintage like 2016, this estate has fashioned some of the greatest wines in its history – one begun by their Italian grandfather in 1948.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The consistency of their portfolio is among their chief talents. With their holdings spread across the entirety of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, the various soils, microclimates, and overall terroirs give the family tremendously diverse plots – all vinified separately – that may be used thoughtfully in blending to create an idealized snapshot of the region in any given vintage. As 2016 has achieved status as one of the greatest ever for the region, spoken in the same breath as the glorious 2010 or the legendary 1990, the pedigree of this wine is towering. Just look at the critic scores! 94, a slew of 93s, and more…good stuff! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The grapes are all manually harvested, partially de-stemmed (dependent on the season), and then fermented on the skins for 24-40 days in concrete vats. Pretty typical, at the end of the day, but it is the aging where Usseglio separates themselves from the majority of their neighbors. 50% of the wine is stored in concrete – to maintain freshness and high-toned aromatic complexity. Also fairly standard. But the remaining 50% is divided into all shapes and sizes of new, used, and neutral wooden barrels – from oak casks to barrels, demi-muids, muid 'oc, and truncated wooden vats – for anywhere from 12 to 18 months. They work with numerous coopers to create vessels that highlight the characteristics of specific parcels, selecting various wood grains and toast levels in order to maintain the highest level of aromatic intensity and concentration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result? This is a flawless iteration of the modern-day CdP…drinkable in its youth, with structure, body, and acidity to drink equally well a decade from now. 80% grenache, 10% syrah, and 5% each cinsault and mourvèdre, this classic blend showcases floral aromatics of lavender and peonies with raspberry liqueur and garrigue. The mouth tends to the darker fruits, with black plum, blackberry, and black cherry, all intertwined with a pronounced minerality and spicy lift of anise and white pepper. The finish is long and deeply structured but culminates in a return to the floral delicacy of the aromatics – creating an intense roller-coaster of twists, turns, and thrills throughout. This is not to be missed! For the price, I’ll put this against CdPs at well over twice the price! Before it’s gone!!!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Cascina Adelaide is a relatively new Barolo producer to keep your eye on. Founded in 1999 as the culmination of a lifelong dream of founder Amabile Droco, this beautifully designed, modern, gravity-fed winery sits just beneath the hilltop Castello di Barolo. This tiny production of just 100 cases is a powerful blend of two of their best crus…all at an amazing price!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are one of the very few in the U.S. to have UNPRECEDENTED access to their top wines, and we purchase every bottle they agree to sell us. For this reserve bottling that was created in homage to Amabile’s partner, Elen, we somehow talked our way into taking over 15% of the entire production! We direct import it ourselves and pass the unreal savings onto you. Truly, this pricing is remarkable, and the wine…even more so! 94 POINTS and decades of life ahead of it…just a surreal treat!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wine is a classic, old-school style of nebbiolo...a perfect marriage of the top crus of Cannubi and Preda. The nose zings with traditional asphalt and rose petal notes, leading to a palate loaded with tobacco, cardamon, cherries and cranberries, anise seed, balsam, and a long, endless finish. This is a towering spectacle of a wine that is youthful and worthy of any Piemonte cellar. Decant vigorously for early drinking, or simply take your time with the wine and watch it blossom over the course of an evening. Just wicked, awesome stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of Cascina Adelaide’s grapes are hand harvested and sorted before a 12-hour stay in the winery’s drying room to remove any residual moisture on the grapes. From there, the fruit is destemmed and lightly crushed in preparation for their roughly two-week fermentation and maceration in tank. Following primary, the wine is aged for 24 months in oak barrels, where secondary fermentation occurs. The wine is then bottled for 3 years of further aging before release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not the retail of $150. Not $100, even. Just $79.95! For rare, micro-production Barolo like this?? Man. Cascina Adelaide owns plots in some of Barolo’s finest vineyards across the appellation (including Baudana, Fossati, Bussia, Preda, and Cannubi), and this is a selection of the best bits of Preda and Cannubi. Just 100 cases! As we noted above, we simply love it! This winery continues to just BLOW UP in the press, and we are beyond stoked to have gotten in early!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read the press below, but don’t delay, this is a CRAZY good price. 47% OFF?!?! For a stellar vintage like 2013? Just JUMP all over this...go!</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Rodgers Creek vineyard is set in from the Petaluma Gap on the cooler side of Sonoma Mountain, helping to provide that elusive savory character that defines classic syrah. With the site situated 800 feet in elevation on the southwestern face, this late-ripening block – planted in 2002 to Syrah 877 Clone – is home to meager volcanic soils that decreases yields to intensify concentration and structure. </p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>To further extract even more color and intensity, the syrah is co-fermented with 8% viognier, with 25% of the syrah left intact as whole clusters. Following the native yeast fermentation, the wine ages in 100% new French oak barrels for 25 months. A monthly battonage during that time ensures that this is textured, creamy, inky, and exceptionally powerful syrah. With explosive flavors and aromas of jasmine, bacon fat, creme de cassis, kirsch, black olives, toasted peppercorns, chocolate-covered blueberries, licorice, and leather…this wine is a panoply of intense, plush notes that coat the palate and leave you dumbstruck whilst the mind unravels all the sheer pleasing sensations layered like a French opera cake. This is warm, brooding and straight-up tasty!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Ramey doesn’t make much of this wine, and we’re thrilled to have gotten some of the 2015 vintage. This is a wine you definitely don’t want to touch on release, so having half a decade in bottle already will serve this to be approachable now (though a brief decant is still suggested). For those so inclined, you easily have two decades further for this wine to develop! Fantastic stuff from an iconic producer at a price that encourages bad behavior. You’ll be thrilled to have a few of these in your collection…while they last, of course!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Beef! It’s what’s for dinner…and truly, the best match for a wine this inky and intense. Try this classic, carrots, and potatoes Beef Stew – slowly simmered to perfection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Sticking with my assertion that Hair Metal and syrah are born to flow, we’re jamming Poison’s <em>“Nothin’ But A Good Time”</em>!",

    "description": "<p>In one of those \"Only in Napa\" moments, we ran into Ryan Pass, partner, winemaker, and all around phenom, one night at one of the very hip wine bars in downtown Napa. After a bottle of Beaujolais and a flight of Champagne, he pulled a shiner of his new, single-vineyard albariño, and offered a taste. Never ones to turn such things down, we agreed. Bam! As though we were all immediately struck by a thunderbolt of vinous lightning, we looked down at our glasses, then at each other, then Ryan... without a word uttered, we concluded. We needed some of this! With only 119 cases total production, this is an exemplary version of albariño’s potential here in California – perhaps the best we’ve ever tasted outside of the Iberian peninsula!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Etxea is a one-man producer, making micro-lots of albariño and cabernet franc. This wine comes from a vineyard way up in the Sierra Foothills, made by winemaker Ryan Pass. He has been making wine at Farella Vineyard since 2015, taking over as head winemaker for Tom Farella in 2018. The same sort of authentic, minimal intervention and thoughtful winemaking found in Tom’s iconic wines can be discovered in Ryan’s Etxea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sourced from Matthew Rorick’s (of Forlorn Hope) 2,000 ft. elevation and organically-farmed vineyard high in the Sierra Foothills, this site has steep slopes on limestone-rich soils. This is a rare geological gem located in Calaveras County, outside the old mining town of Murphys, first ranched by the Shaw family in 1844. Barden Stevenot, the godfather of modern Calaveras winegrowers, purchased the property in the 1960s, planting own-rooted Wente clones in the 70s that still survive today. He expanded the vineyards to 75 acres, taking advantage of a stunning diversity of sun exposures, elevations, temperatures, and soils. When Matthew Rorick purchased the vineyard in 2013, he began the conversion of the vineyard (and all 16 varieties planted there) to organic farming practices. This particular plot of albariño rests on a northeast-facing slope of schist and limestone, just beneath Rosemary Cakebread’s plot for her Gallica label.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The albariño was hand-picked, whole-cluster pressed, and spontaneously fermented with native yeast. The wine then aged on its lees with no sulfur added for ten months in neutral oak before bottling. The wine opens with aromas of yellow peaches and wet stones, leading to a palate of more peaches, tinged with chamomile, and honeydew melon. The wine is lightened by bright, mineral-laden acidity, but nevertheless has the full weight and textured creaminess for which Iberian albariño is prized. We secured as much as we could, but as the TOTAL production on this wine is a meager 119 cases, there is just not much to be had! A true insiders find that you must try to believe. Get yours while it lasts!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: One of my favorite memories from a trip to northern Spain was a seaside tapas bar, a glass of albariño, and the most simply delish and unadorned Gambas al Ajillo. Garlic-y, spicy, and bright, this is a go-to to have in any cook’s repertoire.</P>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Want to see a magic trick? Watch Trace Bundy play guitar. This live version of <em>“Dueling Ninjas”</em>, a glass of this, and a bowl full of gambas? Perfect evening complete.</p>",

    "description": "<P>You might not know the folks at this tiny, off-the-radar project, 12C, but if you love Napa cabernet, that’s about all you won’t recognize here! With fruit from the hallowed ground of Beckstoffer’s George III Vineyard, crafted by Thomas Rivers Brown’s most famous protege, Mike Smith (of Maybach, Myriad, and more…), this wine is primed to explode! 30% off the winery’s price…this is one of the more epic single-vineyard cabernet deals you’ll find in Napa!</P>\r\n\r\n<P>Tucked away at the bottom of the Rutherford bowl on the eastern edge of the AVA, the Georges III Vineyard is one of Napa Valley’s most heralded and historic vineyards. Georges de la Tour, the founder of Beaulieu Vineyard, dubbed the site Vineyard No. 3 when he bought it in the 1920s. Napa Valley winemaking legend André Tchelistcheff crafted award-winning wines from Georges III in the 60s and 70s. When Andy Beckstoffer purchased the vineyard in 1988, he followed up with a full replant of the property to institute tighter spacing with new trellising improvements. </P>\r\n\r\n<P>The folks at 12C were lucky enough to get a small parcel of fruit from the site some years back, thanks primarily to their association with Mike Smith. His Myriad Cellars cabernet sauvignon from George III has routinely received 96-98 point scores, and Andy Beckstoffer is nothing if not a savvy (some would say ruthless) businessman. Smith uses 100% cabernet sauvignon for 12C, saying, <EM>“Beckstoffer Georges III grows the most amazing Cabernet Sauvignon. I don’t need to blend with it. It’s a stand-alone Cabernet Sauvignon terroir.” </EM></P>\r\n\r\n<P>This rich and layered wine reflects the classic Rutherford Dust character which vintner, John Raudabaugh, describes as <em>“uniqueness in terms of smokiness and … an anise taste.”</em> Atop the dusty, earthy layer here, the wine is concentrated with dark black cherry and blackberry fruits, new leather, dark chocolate, violets, roasted fennel, and black peppercorn. Lush and generous, this wine is drinking in its prime here and now, with enough life to continue into maturity for another decade plus. The folks at 12C make only 200-300 cases of this wine each vintage, and this is certainly a wine to be sought out and drunk with carefree abandon! George III at this price? Just boggles the mind, it does. While it lasts!</p>\r\n</P>",

    "description": "<p>Bodegas Mauro is a four decades young superstar in the Castilla y Leon region – started in 1980 by Mariano Garcia. Prior to this, he spent 30 years as the head winemaker of Vega Sicilia...one of the most sought-after wines in the world, before turning his focus to these remarkable, old tempranillo vines in the Duero. Once again, First Bottle has the best price you’ll find in all 50 states...a powerhouse of a wine with a fantastic pedigree!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>30 years running the show at Vega Sicilia...that just might be the very best one-line resume ever. Mariano Garcia has become a living legend of the Duero, now with three estate wineries that each highlight the unique terroirs of various locales throughout the Duero region in north-central Spain. Joined by San Román in ‘97 and Garmon Continental in ‘14, this trio consistently produces some of the best-scoring, most feverishly desired wines in all of Spain. The flagship Bodegas Mauro estate is located in the village of Tudela de Duero, just outside the official lines of the Ribera del Duero DO. The VS for this wine stands for \"Vendimia Seleccionada\", a reference to this wine only being made from the finest estate grapes and only in the best vintages. In some years, a small percentage of syrah is added to the final mix, but in the classic, ripe, and balanced vintage of 2018 – just pure, deep, and concentrated tempranillo was selected. A selection from the best plots of the two vineyards located in the municipalities of Tudela de Duero and Traspinedo – this is old-vine, head-trained tempranillo at its finest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wine spends 26 months in mostly neutral, large oak foudres. These are highly structured, powerful tempranillos that showcase the stressed nature of the meager stony soils, and the challenging continental climate that slowly ripens these small berries. The VS has a reputation for aging, and in a banner year like 2018, it would not be surprising to find this wine still kicking 3+ decades onward. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aromas are deep and earthy, with notes of black figs, cedar, volcanic soil, and fennel seed. The palate is rich and juicy, with pronounced flavors of espresso, olive tapenade, boysenberry, and black cherries. A strong finish with layered minerality and spice goes on and on, hinting at a wine that is just evolving beyond its primary stage – with a long, glorious plateau of maturity soon to come. Decant an hour for early drinking, but again, this one is the perfect addition to any cellar collection and will be enjoyed in the years to come. At a cool $30 off the retail price, this is something to be treasured...while it sticks around, at least!</p>",

    "description": "<p>There’s just not enough Chablis in the world today – especially following a string of exceptional, though low-yielding, vintages. We're just blown away to have this beautiful, classic Petit Chablis at BY FAR the best price in the U.S.!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seriously, we’re talking $17 LESS than the only other two retailers in the U.S.! $27.95 is a steal for any chardonnay of this sort of quality, and we’re thrilled to have recently discovered this tiny producer. Agnès and Didier Dauvissat’s 13-hectare property is based in the village of Beine, just about 10 minutes west of Chablis. While they have attracted a fair share of critical praise since their inception in 1987, they are without question the least famous among the myriad Dauvissat producers (at least for now!). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Domaine is currently run by the second generation, Florent Dauvissat. His connections got him an opportunity to train in the cellars at the far more famous Vincent Dauvissat, as his father Didier, is Vincent’s cousin. By Burgundy standards, this now 35-year-old Domaine is still in its infancy, but with the handful of wines we’ve tasted thus far – the future is shaping up to be fantastic! This is their smallest production, only about 400 cases total, from their 3.5-hectare holdings in Petit Chablis. The fruit hails from several south-facing, old vine parcels near Beine and just above the cluster of Chablis’ seven Grand Crus. All of the fruit is fermented in stainless steel, before aging exclusively in neutral barrels at a minimum of seven years old. Tasted side by side, we actually preferred this Petit Chablis over their Chablis offering...fresher, brighter, and just flat-out TASTY!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wine boasts classic notes of fine Chablis – weight without heaviness, tension, verve, and crunchy textures...everything is in place at a price that leaves you shaking your head in joyous confusion. Flavors of brioche dough, lemon cream, crushed seashell…nicely balanced fruits, minerals, and weight. This wine will hold its own with Premier Cru Chablis at twice the price, truly. Not as much as we would like, and sure to move very, very quickly. While it lasts!</p>",

Wine Enthusiast Top 100 last year, and even poured at the Oscars a couple of years back! We called in a favor…coming your way at 20% off!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jenny Heim is the founder and vintner of Olet’te…she’s a local girl who is just crazy passionate about all things wine. She studied wine business, viticulture, and global wine marketing – truly a Jill-of-all-trades making one of the most exciting new sparkling wines in California! This disgorgement is a masterful blend of chardonnay from Sonoma Coast, Carneros, and Boonville, and just 120 cases were produced...needless to say, we don't have a lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wine is a dry, brightly-flavored sparkler that pours a pale golden hue. The clean and vibrant nose showcases Golden Delicious apples, poached pear, lemon verbena, and pie crust notes, leading into a stone fruit medley on the palate, with rich and ripe flavors of white peach, golden plums, and nectarine – all complemented with a tension of bright acidity and lingering freshness. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is a winery to watch, to be certain, but also, and especially at our price, one to be enjoyed here and now! Very small production, so grab some before it’s gone!</p>",

    "description": "<p>COLLECTORS! This is a special offering just for you, our very, very best First Bottlers. We have exactly 4 bottles available! This is shaping up to be the best Pym Rae yet – and the Napa branch of Chateau Pontet Canet is well on its way to superstardom! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do Robin Williams’ Napa vineyard, Alfred Tesseron (Château Pontet-Canet), and Michel Rolland have in common? This drop-dead AMAZING, lush, intense ‘18 cabernet sauvignon. A MUST for hardcore cabernet aficinados! Incredibly limited! We were incredibly lucky to taste with Alfred Tesseron himself, and this wine exceeds the serious hype. This man has turned Chateau Pontet-Canet into a 100-point powerhouse, rivaling the top estates in Pauillac, and now he is doing the same here in Napa. \r\n\r\n<p>In January 2016, the Tesseron family became the owners of Villa Sorriso (Villa of Smiles), the former property of the actor Robin Williams. The actor christened the vineyard with the middle names of his children “PYM” and “RAE.” Due to this touching story and with respect to the previous owners, the Tesserons have chosen to continue the name Robin gave to the vineyard. The globe pictured on the label was taken from a chandelier that hangs at the entrance to Robin's home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tesseron family has taken everything they have learned over the decades making wine at Pauillac's Pontet Canet and have applied it at this 30-year-old vineyard atop Mt. Veeder. Immediately, they converted the property to organic and biodynamic farming and removed all irrigation (which he was told could not be done in this rugged hillside property), then brought his winemaking team from Pontet-Canet and hired his own full-time farming team. Every detail has been thought out, from meticulous farming to world-class winemaking, and the results are in the bottle. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>You simply MUST taste it to wrap your head around it… intense, with a tannin structure we’ve not come across often, it is PACKED and tightly wound in the best way possible, with masses of blackberries, plum preserves, tobacco, violets, and graphite – with a touch of black pepper spice in a fine, subtle-yet-powerful frame, long, complex and layered. Wonderful. A must-have. ONLY 4 BOTTLES, so, as ever, FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Over the years, we’ve been lucky to sell a bit of Testamatta, but magnums are a first, especially at this fine price. I’m guessing most of you savvy oenophiles need no introduction to Bibi’s wines, but there's a huge raft of scores and info below if you need a refresher! PERFECTION in magnums...we’re just stunned!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>100% sangiovese, of course, as always, 50+ year old vines, made at his medieval castle, Castello di Vincigliata overlooking Florence. Bibi is an icon, self-taught and one of the early “cult” winemakers in Tuscany. He has a reputation of being Italy’s most talented and interesting winemakers. The labels are all personally drawn by Bibi Graetz, with the help from his daughter who both come from a long line of talented visual artists. Bibi is able to combine both of his passions into an amazing masterpiece. The wine in this vintage is five stars with wine publications predicting that this vintage will fall between the lavish 2015s and extravagant 2016s. Don't miss</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: Try something more traditionally Florentine. Did you know they do crepes in Tuscany? Yup – check this out – crespelle alla Fiorentina. Hard to go wrong with ricotta and bechamel, are we right? Here’s a <a href=\"https://www.italymagazine.com/recipe/crespelle-alla-fiorentina\">recipe</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Checked out the new Eddie Vedder album yet? <em>\"Earthling\"</em> is growing on us, check it out. The opening track <em>\"Invincible\"</em> is a great vibe for some world-class sangiovese!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Bibi Graetz is the hottest producer in Tuscany, with his “Testamatta” bottling turning the Tuscan wine biz upside down soon after the first release in the early 2000s. Now, enter “Colore” – his flagship wine taken from the very best barrels and his oldest, highest elevation vines. This 100% sangiovese is a must for any serious Italian wine collector!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2019 vintage marks the 20th anniversary of Bibi Graetz winery. What a couple of decades! Countless 95-100 point scores and a reputation that went almost immediately to rising star and is now approaching all-time legendary status. His impact on Italian wine has been staggering, and we’re just thrilled to have stumbled upon these wines some years back. His winery sits on the hill of Fiesole, overlooking the verdant, rolling foothills of Florence in the heart of Tuscany. From the very beginning, his goal was to acquire some of the oldest vineyards in Tuscany, with a focus on the ancient, local varietals, Sangiovese being chief amongst those, but also including Canaiolo and Colorino.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>“Colore” is the highest expression of his dream, from very old vineyards of Sangiovese that are 70, 80, or even 90 years old. Fruit from three separate vineyards – Lamole, Vincigliata, and Siena – is the basis of this blend, though only the best barrels make the final bottling. Set on porous soils of sand mixed with stone, these high-altitude vines are hand-harvested, with up to eight passes through each vineyard, pulling only those clusters that are perfectly ripe. The fruit is sorted again at the winery before undergoing spontaneous fermentations in old, open-top barriques. The grapes are punched down by hand 6-8 times each day during fermentation before transferring to new barriques where they’ll finish secondary fermentation as they age for the next 20 months.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The 2019 vintage was a remarkable one for the region, and Bibi had this to say about the conditions, <em>“Monumental, there is no better word to describe this vintage. Roundness in every single aspect of the wine: elegance, freshness and great acidity that gives very fine layers, surprisingly detectable on the nose and at the first sip. Colore 2019 celebrates my 20th anniversary as a winemaker. It has been a great journey since 2000, full of satisfactions and now with this vintage I finally close the circle. My wines at the beginning were looking for structure and concentration, in 2009 I realized that “elegance” should have been the main drive. In 2019 I did it!”</em></p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Can’t disagree in the slightest. This effort is powerful, taut, and exceptionally structured – elegance is interwoven throughout, but make no mistake, this is ample, layered, and even intimidating in its youthful exuberance. This is a wine to be treasured, and any patience shown will be rewarded threefold over the years to come. Classic cherries, berries, and red currants, with tinges of blood orange, spearmint oil, toasted fennel seed, savory balsam herbs, and camphor. This is serious stuff that will only get even better as time marches on. We only have 7 cases…do what you must and grab a few of these for your collection! While they last!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: When the time comes, make this classic, super easy, Tuscan dish: Spaghetti con Salsiccia e Cavolo Nero – the bitterness of the kale, the richness of the Italian sausage, the spice of the fried garlic… it all just works so beautifully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: What else but Pink Floyd’s <em>“Time”</em> … patience is required on this beauty, but don’t let the years pass you by without enjoying a great wine like this either!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Made by the Sabon family of Châteauneuf du Pape’s revered Domaine de la Janasse, Clos Saint Antonin is a new project from their estate to the north, across the river from Gigondas. From old vines in the village of Plan de Dieu, this wine drinks like Châteauneuf’s richer cousin. At NEARLY 60% OFF, this is a new find that every CdP lover needs to try!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seriously, $18.95 for a “Baby Châteauneuf” that Jeb Dunnuck says “will give many a Châteauneuf du Pape a run for its money”... are we for real?!?! You bet. This is a classic southern Rhone blend – roughly 50% grenache, 30% mourvedre, and 20% syrah from 50+-year-old vines in iron-rich clay soils littered with the region's famous “rolled pebble” stones. The varieties are harvested and fermented separately, with the grenache aged in large oak foudres while the syrah and mourvedre spend their time in neutral barriques. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The style of this wine is unapologetically hedonistic, with rich, dark, and ripe fruit notes of blackberries, black plums, and mulberries. The fruits are punctuated with ample spice notes of garrigue, black pepper, and clove – uplifted by a mineral edge and delicately floral tones. This has the structure and weight to survive another 5-7 years beautifully, but for pure, unbridled pleasure…it’s drinking quite well in the here and now! Delightfully complex and richly pleasing wine, even at the full retail of $45…but at 58% OFF, this is a tremendous wine to have in quantity. While it lasts!</p>",

    "description": "<p>This is just for you, our very select tip-top best First Bottlers. 100 point Priorat…don’t see that every day, do ya? This is an infinitesimally small, 225 case total production, 100% carignan, 80+-year-old vines, high elevation, black slate soils, from the heart of the Torroja del Priorat…seriously cool stuff, through and through. Only about 4 cases are available, and this is one that can’t be missed!!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dominik Huber has created something truly magical in the high-altitude, barren landscape of Torroja del Priorat. Starting as a project with Eben Sadie, who makes perhaps the very best South African wines under his Sadie Family label, Dominik has turned out a portfolio of fantastic wines that would make any estate in the world envious. In 2021 alone, Terroir al Limit has turned out 5 distinct wines that all received 95+ point scores from Wine Advocate! He’s a phenom that is changing the game in Priorat, one of Spain’s most historic and long-standing regions. His focus on a varietal-dominant carignan wine is rare for the region, but he has harnessed the complexity and power of this site to create a singular wine that just simply must be tasted to be believed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grown at some 2000 feet above sea level, in the arid, hot hillsides of Priorat, overlooking the Mediterranean port of Tarragona in the Northeast of Spain, this vineyard belongs to another time. The Catalonian village is ancient, with clay roofs, closely set buildings of earthen stone, and cobblestone streets. Cooling breezes that bring in moisture from the sea act as a moderating influence, allowing these 72-year-old vines to produce small amounts of highly concentrated fruit. Over the years, Dominik has limited the use of oak, both for fermentation and aging, and going forward (as of 2020) the winery’s red wines will be fermented and aged entirely in concrete vats. For this 2017 vintage, 70% of the wine was aged in large neutral oak foudres, with 30% in concrete. This is a mysterious beauty to drink, a wine so layered, so dichotomous, so uniquely pleasing that I’m having trouble selecting the dominant characteristics… is it the black cherry? The licorice and lavender pastilles? Mushroom tea and roasted herbs? Blueberries and violets? It’s all there, and so much more, just waiting to be experienced by the bold, the wise, and the undaunted. Double 96s, 97, 100...the critics have spoken. If pressed, I’m going with a 99, because just like the Great One, the stats, the presence, the total package – it is all just impossible to properly quantify – but no one, anywhere, questions the greatness. While it lasts!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Jumilla is a relatively obscure Spanish region despite its long history. Casa Castillo is primed to change that, as they continually make some of the highest quality for value vines in the world. Following a slew of great scores (every Las Gravas since 2012 has scored 94 or higher with Robert Parker’s Wine Advocate), they have exploded with this 98 POINT beauty!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>“Considered by many observers to be the finest estate in Jumilla, Casa Castillo is a treasure-trove for fabulous values, particularly from the Monastrell (Mourvedre) grape that loves the chalky terroirs and cool slopes of the Sierra del Molar.”</em> - Robert Parker, Jr.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, indeed. José Maria Vicente is a third-generation owner and operator of Casa Castillo, a farm that began as a rosemary plantation but has evolved into the preeminent estate in the DO of Jumilla. The winery and vineyards came to the Vicente family in 1941, though the estate didn’t begin producing its own label until fifty years later. This is a long-time Wine Advocate favorite, and we absolutely loved the 2015 vintage we offered a few years back. This is ASTOUNDINGLY DELICIOUS at any price – at our best-in-the-states price… you simply HAVE to taste it!</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>The family’s vineyard holding became certified organic in 2019, but their 2020 vintage is without question the finest they’ve produced since they began over 30 years ago. 92% monastrell (the local name for mourvedre), rounded out with 8% garnacha (grenache) – this is a bold, bright-flavored wine with perfumed and floral aromatics, leading to earthy, resinous notes of pine needles, and dried ceps. The palate abounds with red cherries, chipped rocks, pink peppercorns, and creamy oak sensations. Reminiscent of a highly polished Bandol, there is a vein of purity here where weight and textures are lifted up – creating a full wine that nevertheless floats effortlessly across the palate. Just a monumental effort that needs to be experienced to be believed.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Get in on this producer now while you can. They are already on the rise, and their prices are sure to go the way of top-flight Toros and Riojas before long! A cool $30 off for this 98 POINT stunner? Not to be missed.</p>",

The fruit is grown from the highest point on the Hartwell estate and aged for two years in prized Taransaud T5 barrels. Cabernet collectors...this hits EVERY SINGLE sweet spot today. A MUST at our price. T5 is in the heart of the Stags Leap District, sourced from the highest point on the Hartwell estate, overlooking what is now Realm winery. Ultra-fine, polished, sexy juice, with an enormous aging curve – the wine is truly blockbuster - packed to the gills with extract, concentration, and turned-up-to-100 flavors and mouthfeel.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Let’s talk about a true rockstar winemaker, as well - Benoit Touquette. He is the Frenchman, student of Michel Rolland (who also consults at Hartwell and Realm), and too-many-huge-scores-to-count winemaker here, besides his epically collectible other wines such as Realm, Kata, Fait-Main and more.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, besides the incredible rarity of this bottling (and our eye-popping price), 2013 is a FANTASTIC vintage in the Valley. Now with a few years of age on it, it has grown into itself and drinking fabulously. Here’s a few of the pros on the vintage:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>\"...the finest vintage for Bordeaux varietals I've ever tasted in my 37 years of experience in Napa Valley...\"</em> - Robert Parker, Jr. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>\"The 2013s are majestic wines of the very highest level...\"</em> - Antonio Galloni</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>\"...one of the most epic and awesome vintages the North Coast of California has ever produced, especially for Bordeaux varieties...\"</em> - Robert Parker, Jr.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>NOT a cab for the shy, but definitely for those looking for something TRULY special and unique! We have a TINY, tiny amount to offer -- first come, first served!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIRING IDEAS: This wine is SO big and brawny, we’re going to go with LAMB. Grind some for a killer burger (with a bit of tzatziki sauce), or ideally, grill up a leg of lamb you’ve slathered with herbs and garlic and red wine and EVOO, grilled and smoked on your Weber. Yum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSIC SUGGESTIONS: Rock out. <em>“The Descent”</em> by Bob Mould from the excellent Silver Age album sounds amazing up LOUD.</p>",

    "description": "<div>We were one of the very first “online” retailers in the USA to sell this wine back in the day when it was first offered (2009), and we still rock it every year it is made. A terrific Premier Cru bottling that encompasses 17 of the 1ers within Beaune, it was first created in the ‘09 vintage to commemorate the winery’s 150th anniversary and is still made in very good years. No surprise, it is a blockbuster. If you haven’t bought any 2015 red Burgundy, this is one not to miss. If you have already, this can serve as a cellar staple and makes an excellent centerpiece for your own Burgundy-drinking adventures for years to come!</div><div><br></div><div>The contrast between the writeups for this wine from Decanter (96) and Vinous (93+) is striking, although both of them rave about it, and rightly so -- you can read them below. We, of course, had to open some to drink ourselves, because...Burgundy! Never miss an opportunity. Our notes: Floral. Beautiful color. Apple, cinnamon, juicy plum, a whiff of oak. Great structure, wonderful density and texture, SUPER-long, complex, finish. We're leaning quite a bit more to the Decanter side of things, although this is clearly a BABY and will improve for many years. Wonderful -- esp. at our PRICE!</div><div><br></div>First come, first served!",

    "description": "One of our all-time fave Cabs from the legendary Heidi Barrett!! A FANTASTIC, no-brainer bargain relative to so many other Napa Cabs and arguably the finest in a decade or more! A Napa Valley classic since the late 80s!!<br><p>Did you know this is Heidi Barrett's only continuous client since they began? From her Screaming Eagle days to her current mega-stardom, she has always made this wine in a much more \"classic\" style that I utterly love. <em>Less super-oak, some structure, medium-weight, terrific balance...and they age gorgeously</em> (<em>drink the 1994 now, it's killer</em>).<em> A huge must-have every year, in my book.</em></p><p>$79.95. Do you even know what a ridonkulously fair price this is? I urge, I insist, I PLEAD that if you love classically structured Napa Cabs (<em>I want you to evoke things like Dunn, Heitz, Mayacamas, old Phelps wines and so on</em>) --- this is a MUST-BUY. 2015 to boot, which has an amazing ripe fruit profile that will drink well early but will also cellar like a champ! A fantastic vintage! Trust your wizened old, grizzly-bearded, cantankerous wine merchant! This wine is KILLING it!</p>",

    "description": "<p>It’s not often we get an opportunity on one of the rarest, most coveted, late-harvest wines to be had in the world today! Trockenbeerenauslese from Pfalz in the southwest of Germany! Just in time for the holidays, this is an incredibly delicious dessert wine – at a fraction of the cost, these wines typically fetch!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alright, let’s start with a little info, for those not familiar with this rare creature… “Trockenbeerenauslese” translates to \"dry berry selection\" – a reference to the German classification system based on the ripeness level and sugar content of the grapes. This sweet dessert wine is made from individually selected, botrytis-affected grapes that have the highest sugar levels possible. The grapes are all hand-picked, oftentimes berry by berry, in a painstakingly difficult process, before fermenting. The grapes are almost fully desiccated at the time of harvest, with extremely concentrated sugars and flavors that make these wines so special. Trockenbeerenauslese wines rank among the greatest sweet wines in the world alongside Royal Tokaji and Sauternes, yet because German wines come in at every sweetness level across the spectrum, these extremely late-harvest wines are perhaps rarer here than anywhere else in the world!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet, while this wine is undoubtedly sweet… it is also so much more than just that! Intense acidity cuts any possibility of the wine coming across as cloying, and the mineral/herbal notes add complexity to the myriad fruit flavors of peaches, honeyed apricots, and orange marmalade. The viscous, creamy weight of the wine makes for a sip that goes on forever, with deeply rich and intense flavors exploding across all facets of your palate. </p>\r\n\r\n The Anselmann family has been consistently growing grapes and making wines in the region over the last 450 years… and there are even documents that show the family’s ownership of vineyards as far back as 1126! They’re an iconic Rhineland producer that has produced every type of wine grape conceivable for Germany, with 150 hectares planted to traditional varieties like riesling and pinot noir (spatburgunder) as well as uncommon grapes such as tempranillo, solaris, cabernet blanc, and this grape, ortega. Ortega is a cross created in 1948 by pairing müller-thurgau with scheurebe grapes, creating a frost-resistant berry that is prized for its stone fruit aromatics, high sugar potential, and relatively early ripening. All this is extremely important for the site and style of this wine, and the result is nothing short of spectacular! Words simply cannot do it justice… this is a wine that needs to be tasted! Luckily, at our fantastic price, you can do so, all without having to hop on a plane to Frankfurt! While it lasts!</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>“One of Piedmont’s superstars… these are wines of extraordinary complexity and breathtaking richness.”</em> - Robert Parker, Jr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yep, no argument there. Luigi Pira is a consistent favorite producer in Serralunga d’ Alba, situated at the very heart of Barolo. This single cru bottling, Margheria, is one of three cru Pira holdings in Serralunga and stands as the oldest cru in the portfolio. Set on 1.5 hectares of calcareous clay soils, these vines average 50 years of age, with some of the original plantings for the vineyard that goes back to 1959. The site is known for its elegance, minerality, and ageability of the wines produced there – and this wine excels in all three of those categories. 95 points to start, with other top critics' scores soon to follow, this beauty isn’t likely to be around for long!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is one for the ages – intensely flavored and wonderfully floral, with earthy and sweet notes of dried cherries and roses, new leather, and fresh hay leading into an immensely long finish layered with saline edges and iron ore. So ethereally complex, supremely elegant, and undoubtedly delicious! At this price, I’m getting six...one to open every three years!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like so many highly collectible producers in the Barolo (especially Serralunga!), in the early part of the 20th century, Pira’s top grapes were sold to other producers, such as Gaja and others, for decades. In the early 90s, Gianpaolo, Luigi's son, started to take part in the winery management, and wine quality became the key factor. More of the best fruit was kept in-house and the prestige of this small producer grew and grew. Today, Gianpaolo runs the winemaking, and his brothers, Romolo and Claudio, focus on tending the vineyards. A true family affair with a bright and illustrious history to come, this is a remarkable deal on cru Barolo from a top producer. While it lasts!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Gallimard just makes us proud. We discovered them some years back, when they were completely unknown outside of France, and started importing as much as they would give us. The wines have just gotten better and better every year, and now, the world is taking note. These are grower-producers of the first order, pushing the envelope in the Cote de Bars and changing the game of pinot noir-based Champagnes! Nearly HALF OFF...UNDER $35?!?! Just remarkable stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Didier and Arnaud make the perfect father-son team. Didier is the old guard, rooted in tradition and paying homage to the generations of the family who farmed this land before. Arnaud is the future, experimenting, re-evaluating, and driving the wines to newfound heights – even chosen by Wine Enthusiast as one of the \"Champagne Producers Redefining France’s Bubbly.\" Combined, they are the perfect complement to one another – mad scientist and wizened sage – ever evolving without getting too far off track. We’ve certainly noticed an uptick in their overall quality over the past few years and this beauty just might be one of their best yet!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A blend of 85% pinot noir and 15% chardonnay from Les Riceys, located in the Côte des Bar, the heart of Champagne. These vines are grown in the region’s mix of clay and chalk soils amongst the rolling wood-topped hills surrounding their village...an area well-suited to pinot noir. The wine is matured in a combination of oak barrels and four egg-shaped clay amphorae the family imported from Tuscany. After spending 7 years on the lees, the wine is disgorged in the “à la volée” style, wherein the yeast is forcefully expelled without first freezing the neck of the bottle. Quite the sight! The dosage here is 8 grams per liter, and the balance and harmony provided are pristine. It’s utterly delicious, compelling stuff that is laser-focused and bubbling with apricot marmalade, pie crust, white flowers, poached pear, and lemon curd...MMMM!! Rich and weighty on the palate, this has a slight caramel finish to complement the baked apple, citrus, and toasty layers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, Arnaud Gallimard is a certified rockstar. At a sparkling over 45% OFF, this is a bubble for stocking you up through the holidays and beyond...while it lasts, of course!</p>",

    "description": "<p>Ah, Bourgueil! Cabernet franc may be a blending grape in Bordeaux and most other regions around the world, but here, in the heart of the Loire, cabernet franc is KING! The Audebert family, a Kermit Lynch find from decades past, is one of our favorite franc producers and this parcel from their 60-year-old vines is just mind-shatteringly wicked good juice. Normally $50, but here at First Bottle, we waived the magical wine wand to bring it to you for only $29.95!!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yep, that’s a solid 40% OFF on some of the most highly-sought Loire cabernet franc in the world. Sommeliers have been gobbling this up for years, and not just for the obvious quality, the unbelievable food friendliness, and the fascinating history, either… this wine is built to last! Similar to how the wine world recently learned that cru Beaujolais is one of the best aging dry red wines in the world, Bourgueil cabernet franc (locally dubbed cabernet breton) has the distinct capability to age for decades! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This 1.5-hectare site, where 60-year-old vines dominate, is set amongst a rich, clay, and limestone soil in the commune of Benais. The vineyard is known for producing the most powerfully structured wines in the Audebert portfolio, and vintages from three decades past are still drinking well today. Aging is not required, however, as the pure bright fruit notes, the red floral overtones, and the supple and spicy earth notes are all there to be enjoyed, even in its “youth” (at seven years young already, many lesser Loire cabernet francs would be nearing the end of their life and not the beginning of maturity as this one is here!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This remarkable wine is highly perfumed with hibiscus flowers, dried violets, and cranberry tea, followed by deeply flavored notes of fresh-made berry jam, cardamom, burdock root, clove, and cool spearmint. The finish is long, intense, and spicy, with notes of iron ore and smoked meats. Unbelievably complex and primordially satisfying, this is a cabernet franc that bridges the void between your prototypical Chinons and the rich, lush cabernet francs from Bolgheri, Napa, and Bordeaux’s Right Bank. For $29.95?!?! Don’t miss this!!!</p>",

Despite his young age, Marcel Guigal took over from his father in 1961 when the latter was victim to a brutal illness rendering him blind. Marcel's hard work and perseverance enabled the Guigals to buy out Vidal-Fleury in 1984, although the establishment retains its own identity and commercial autonomy. In 2000, the Guigals purchased the Jean-Louis Grippat estate in Saint-Joseph and Hermitage, as well as the Domaine de Vallouit in Côte-Rôtie, Hermitage, Saint-Joseph and Crozes-Hermitage. Produced from seven of the most exceptional plots of the domain, Château d’Ampuis is a classy wine with toasty aromas of black fruit.

    "description": "A 2,000 year old estate that dates back to the Roman Empire, has been farmed without the use of chemicals since 470 AD, and a bio-dynamic pioneer since 1971?!? That’s Nikolaihof. Owned and operated by the Saahs family since the late 1800s, this remarkable estate is the jewel of the Wachau. While they make plenty of world class rieslings and grüner veltliners, this is a dry muscat – and the perfect introduction to this estate. Delightfully aromatic, mouth coating and watering, this is crisp, focused, and mineral-driven in a structured manner not typically seen in the varietal. Grown on river gravel and loess from the nearby Danube, this wine takes a serious twist on a normally playful grape. Flavors and aromas of apricot, fresh herbs, pomelo, and crushed rocks carry the day, with structure to last a decade! Cool stuff and not to be missed!",
